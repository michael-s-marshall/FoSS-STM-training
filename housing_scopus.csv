Placemaking is likely to be particularly beneficial to public housing tenants, and is a current priority for public housing providers; yet reviews of placemaking research have failed to consider public housing. Our systematic quantitative review of 63 English-language journal articles reveals that the field is dominated by qualitative cross-sectional studies conducted in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, in the context of regeneration, and published in social science journals. Our thematic analysis of this literature shows that placemaking is supported by forming relationships and participating in community activities, by access to quality public space and amenities, and by spending time and forming memories in a place. The review therefore provides guidance to public housing providers and reveals the need for particular research, including longitudinal studies, and studies conducted in both redeveloped and existing communities. © 2023 The Author(s).

Sellers and estate agents have encountered falling demand and prices, elevated safety concerns, reluctant lenders and changes in buyers’ preferences. Against this backdrop, we investigated the narratives and images used to sell what have sometimes appeared to be ‘less sellable’ homes. Analysing the textual and visual content of 100 adverts for city centre flats, we explored the possible effects of the pandemic on property advertising, the positioning within adverts of building safety and, noting growing interest in sustainability, the presence of sustainability messages. Findings suggest that the core narratives used to sell city centre flats remain largely unchanged from those deployed to first market the concept of ‘city living’ to UK buyers in the late 1990s.

This paper proposes a resource-orientated causal explanation of the mechanisms of family homelessness in Australia. Given the critical role of poverty in housing insecurity, the model explains why some families living in extreme poverty and disadvantage become homeless and others do not. The research is positioned within a critical realist approach to theoretical causal explanation. It is influenced by interdisciplinary literature and psychologist Hobfoll’s Conservation of Resources theory. Previously published empirical analysis informs and supports the development of this theoretical model. Families use their resources to mitigate challenges to their housing security. However, disadvantage limits their accumulation of resources, contributes to accelerating resource loss, and constrains their capacity to act. An acute lack of affordable housing and insufficient welfare payments to secure private rental accommodation severely impacts a family’s capacity to navigate crises and avoid homelessness. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",critical realism; disadvantage; family,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151436623,0

We emphasise the importance of mixing ‘invited’ strategies with ‘ínvented’ strategies, highlighting, simultaneously, the significance of the economic and political context as the stage where the struggles and their opportunities develop. Success is always situated within a context. In this sense, the focus on the reputational pressure of some actors of the state is identified as a way of obtaining results under certain conditions.

Lockdowns, established to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, forced millions of people to take shelter in their homes, enhancing the need to understand the characteristics of the dwelling that promote psychological restoration. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between some perceived conditions of dwelling habitability (appreciation of the physical environment, visible nature, crowding, and privacy) and their effect on psychological restoration through the concept of the perceived restorativeness of dwelling. An online survey was carried out with the participation of 478 Mexican adults. Physical environment, visible nature, crowding, and privacy showed significant correlations with the perceived restorativeness of housing and psychological restoration itself. However, only privacy showed an effect on psychological restoration in structural modelling. We propose that privacy is fundamental to improving dwellings’ restorativeness and restoring their inhabitants, and experts should consider it when designing housing spaces.

Findings show that dwelling ownership, dwelling size, perceived neighbourhood safety, and socializing with friends and neighbours locally are all associated with intentions to live longer in a neighbourhood. Residents of older compact neighbourhoods are found to participate more frequently in activities locally and seem to have stronger local social ties than residents of newly densified neighbourhoods.

This study examines this issue in the context of urban China, where housing affordability has become one of the most pressing social issues and its health implications have aroused academic interests. We aim to enrich the literature by specifying the mental health implications of housing affordability for different population groups and geographical regions. We focus on homeowners living in urban China. Data from the 2016 Wave of the China Family Panel Studies are used for the study. Models are developed for the whole sample and for subsamples of different socioeconomic backgrounds or from different Chinese regions. We find that the mental health impacts of housing affordability are significantly different for different population groups. For examples, though males are in general mentally healthier than females, they are more likely to mentally suffer from housing unaffordability than females; unaffordable housing owners with non-agricultural Hukou are more likely to sacrifice mental health than those with agricultural Hukou, despite that the former are mentally healthier than the latter; housing unaffordability costs mental health for people living in the Western region, but not for those living in other regions of China. We argue that these group differences in the Chinese context may be attributed to a number of factors distinguishing China from other countries including the Hukou system and the large regional differences in social and economic development. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",China; Housing affordability; mental health; neighbourhood; regions; socioeconomic groups,affordable housing; health care; housing market; mental health; neighborhood; panel data; socioeconomic status; urban area; urban population; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150160880,1

The paper advances a multidimensional understanding of housing inequality, as the limited access and poor quality of housing that young adults experience reproduces inequality in a broader sense: It influences potential wealth accumulation, the possibility to lead independent lives, the access to work and education, and thereby, the young adults’ health and well-being. © 2021 The Author(s).

Land value-based tools for developing low-income housing, like India’s In Situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR, part of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana—Urban scheme), seek to balance welfare and economic agendas, but have not achieved expected results. ISSR’s focus on attracting private capital to redevelop India’s slums reflects a perceived rent gap on slum lands. This paper dissects this perception using a probabilistic simulation model to assess the scheme’s feasibility and profitability, integrating data on slums, real-estate markets and policy incentives. The paper proposes a Land Shape Index, identifying slum land shape as a critical—and overlooked—determinant of rent gap. Finding little to no rent gap on slum lands across big and small cities—reflected in ISSR’s low uptake—the paper argues that land value-based capital-led slum redevelopment is unlikely to gain traction and scale.

Individual landlordism is a key feature of this resurgence. This paper aims to understand the networked geographies of private landlordism. Drawing on Dutch register data, containing geocoded information on the full population and housing stock, this paper is able to uniquely link private-rental units to their (landlord) owners. By linking landlords’ places of residence and investment, flows of capital across space are visualized. Empirically, these findings show that, despite the liquidity of capital and the typical focus on transnational investments, most landlords invest locally or regionally, resulting in urban-regional networks of landlordism. These patterns pertain to landlord spatial strategies as well as the functioning of urban systems. Conceptually, findings demonstrate that property-based class relations between tenants and landlords are spatial relations as well, linking places of accumulation with places of extraction and reproducing spatial patterns of (dis)advantage. © 2023 The Author(s).

This contribution reveals their lived experiences on the regular housing market, which exposes them to contingency, inaccessibility and exclusion. Based on interviews with 20 households who received refugee status in Belgium after 2015, the article puts the urban studies notion of displacement into dialogue with the notion of precariousness in housing studies, arguing that refugees develop a sense of continued displacement.

We find that substandard housing and ineffective heating is associated with a higher risk of poor health in an urban context. We surveyed people living in two middle-sized cities in a coal-dependent region of Poland and used objective and subjective indicators of energy poverty and self-assessed health status. We demonstrate that people who live in substandard housing are more likely to exhibit poor musculoskeletal and cardiovascular outcomes, by 10 and 6 pp, respectively than otherwise similar people living in suitable housing conditions. We show that energy-poor people who use coal or a wood stove have a 24 pp higher likelihood of respiratory disease than the energy-poor who live in flats connected to district heating. We also find that a significant amount of the explained variance in the probability of respiratory disease is attributable to energy poverty. To improve the housing conditions and reduce the risk of poor health outcomes, we recommend two policy instruments: 1) a full subsidy for thermal retrofits and connecting multi-family buildings to the district heating network and 2) a targeted energy voucher for clean heating. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",air pollution; D10; energy poverty; health; heating; housing; I14; I32; Q53,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148611262,0

However, the strength of this association depends on the proximity to temporarily unchanged parks. We also found that the value of park proximity among housing buyers rises, suggesting the increased desirability of living close to parks, resulting in more intense residential change close to parks than in other locations. Therefore, scholars should consider green gentrification as a process that may be induced by time (in)variant green spaces.

Public discourses often pose shared renting as a potential solution to the ‘housing crisis’, with new regulation and investment stimulating conversions to multiple-occupancy and growth in co-living developments. This paper addresses how Amsterdam, a deeply regulated market, has approached affordability concerns through transformations in the shared rental sector. Drawing on secondary data and stakeholder interviews we analyze developments in the institutional features of shared housing, focusing on the regulatory context under neo-liberal pressures. We identify shifts from ‘traditional’, relatively informalized sharing arrangements towards a more complex and institutionalized sector featuring growth and diversification in co-living provision. Beyond illustrating interaction between changing real-estate investment practices and Amsterdam’s socioeconomic and regulatory context, our analysis innovates a rough typology of sharing and co-living and seeks to contribute to understanding of emerging forms of housing and precarity characteristic to the experiences of young urbanites. © 2023 The Author(s).

Using data from the 2016 Canadian Census, we assess whether the likelihood of living in unaffordable housing (i.e. spending 30% or more of pretax income on housing costs) varies by ethno-race and nativity status, and identify the social factors contributing to these differences. We show that Middle Eastern and North Africans (MENAs) are most, and Whites are least, likely to live in unaffordable housing. Results from decomposition analyses suggest that MENA individuals’ high unaffordable housing rates are largely attributable to their high unemployment rates. The high unaffordable housing rates of East and South Asians are mainly associated with their higher propensity to live in urban areas with expensive housing. Immigrants are generally more likely than Canadian-born co-ethnics to live in unaffordable housing. Blacks and Southeast Asians are exceptions. As many governments take steps to address housing affordability crises, they should curtail the influence of structural barriers that preclude ethno-racial minorities from living in affordable housing. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Housing affordability; immigration; racial inequality; racial minorities; unaffordable housing,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147693833,1

We develop our training around three theoretical mechanisms of discrimination that are measured through a specified vignette experiment in pre- and post-tests. Our results show a reduction in statistical and customer taste-based discrimination after the training, but no change in agent taste-based discrimination. The driver for this reduction in discrimination is being more selective on majority candidates rather than increasing the chances of ethnic minority candidates. Additionally, we found that training has no effect on taste and that most of these effects remain present on the long term. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Ethnic discrimination; housing market; intersectionality; training intervention; vignette experiment,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147666141,1

Economic migrants to the UK often lack housing support, and access housing in the private rented sector (PRS), where they struggle to secure safe, decent and affordable accommodation. This article presents a qualitative exploration of low-income economic migrants’ lived experiences of housing precarity, based on research in Manchester. Housing represents a critical element of migrants’ experiences, which can have a determining effect on other outcomes. Yet despite the acknowledged higher levels of precarity in the PRS, there have been few in-depth studies of how tenants experience this, particularly at the lower end of the sector. The conceptual lens of precarity offers a deeper understanding of the affective dimension, multidimensionality and structure-agency dynamics of low-income migrants’ housing experiences. In this way, the paper contributes to debates on insecurity, perception, and agency in housing studies. © 2021 The Author(s).

The analysis indicates that residents’ decisions to stay and move reflect attachment to home, integration within the community, practical considerations such as finances, and a range of emotional responses.

We find that decreases in the share of the BMR sector are associated with significant increases in residualization. Increases in rent differences between the BMR and market rate rental sector are related to larger degrees of residualization. We further observe a rising level of residualization for most countries.

This theory leans on the concept of ‘professionalism’ in two ways. Firstly, agents’ professional identities build in them both the capacity and the motivation to affect the price setting mechanism. Secondly, agents’ professional identities are conceptualised as a political inheritance, and therefore something that can indicate how housing markets have been configured and constructed by the wider political context. This paper interrogates this theory, using it to study the significance of high-street estate agents to house price inflation in London. While the intermediary turn proposes a causal effect between agents’ work and price inflation, evidencing this causal effect was an empirical problem. Nevertheless the concept of professionalism was used to reveal a professional identity bound up in housing investment. We argue that this professionalism could be highly significant, offering an insight into the contextual political economy of housing. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Estate agents; housing investment; market intermediaries; professionalism,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106296812,0

The provision of consumer choice can be constrained when housing markets are tight, or when consumers seek congregate living when scattered-site is the focus. Choice can also be a challenge if consumers request housing readiness prior to re-housing. While the principle of choice has allowed services to move away from a staircase model, also considered as a “one size fits all” approach, we need to critically assess whether our current system supports self-determination around unique needs and preferences.

The idea of residualisation and the presumption of its inevitability have become widely accepted, and formed a negative frame for social housing policy. However Pearce and Vine (2014) have shown that in terms of income, the residualisation of social housing in England stopped in 1991. This paper confirms and extends that work using multiple published data sources. These show consistent evidence of convergence over the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s between social tenants and the English national averages in terms of not only income but also employment status and class. Potential explanations, including the restructuring of housing markets, demographic change, and changing labour markets, are briefly explored.

This long-run perspective allows for inquiring about the dynamic effects of rent control on the rise of homeownership as the dominant tenure during the twentieth century. We find that both rent regulation and rationing measures were followed by increases of homeownership and decreases of private rentals.

Following a qualitative literature review to identify what housing functions are and investigate their effects on the housing system, we explore the applicability of such functions in Swiss tenants’ residential mobility. Results show that multiple functions co-exist in the housing realm, each of which determines various human (i.e. residential preferences) and material (i.e. dwelling forms) behaviours that vary according to given societal and environmental structural elements (e.g. geography, culture).

While building policies improved some participants’ perceived safety or autonomy, these policies simultaneously interfered with other participants’ efforts to meet alternative needs.

Using newly compiled indicators of multiple dimensions of the housing context we explore housing from the perspective of renters and homebuyers and examine differences for former-communist and non-former-communist countries. We use six indicators of the housing context and combine them into three different indexes: renter support index, homebuyer support index, and a combined index of both dimensions. Analyses show that access to housing is associated with age at first birth, but that this relationship has changed over time and is different for former-communist and non-former-communist countries.

Second, that this ‘essential contestability’ is not just a theoretical label, it tells us something useful about how scholars can best employ the concept of home in their own work. The argument is put in three sections. The first provides a summary of Gallie’s theory. The second argues that the concept of home meets Gallie’s conditions for essential contestability. Finally, the third outlines the implications of the arguments put in the first two sections for scholars engaging with the concept of home. © 2021 The Author(s).

More specifically, the study tries to identify objective norms that maximize this relationship. The data is taken from the EU-SILC 2016 and the Flemish Housing Survey 2013. The analysis suggests that in Flanders a ratio with variable norms (by income groups) more closely reflects the subjective perception of affordability problems than the ratio indicators with fixed norms.

Penghuqu can be conceived as informality due to its physical conditions, but it is also an ambiguous category that leaves the local state with the space of discretion. By looking at the largest penghuqu redevelopment project in Sichuan, this article demonstrates that under the shield of penghuqu, the local government can deconstruct formal neighbourhood and informalise it as penghuqu, to meet with different political demands. By doing so, this article attempts to empirically add more variants to informal settlements, and theoretically further extend the ongoing debate that conceptualises informality in a relational way. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",China; housing policy; Informality; penghuqu; urban redevelopment,homeownership; housing policy; local government; neighborhood; urban area; urban development; China; Sichuan,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101905957,0

It is difficult to assess these claims with any rigor because a definition of what constitutes a tiny house remains elusive. It is unclear whether they represent a small, specialized housing niche or a significant ‘movement’. Drawing on data from questionnaire surveys and interviews conducted in Australia and social media, we argue the need to develop more precise definitions of the extent of tiny house living and the wider socio-cultural aspects underpinning claims of a new movement. We explore five major themes: four that motivate tiny house living—economic, secure tenure, sustainable community and freedom; and one deterrent—regulatory barriers. Our findings suggest the Australian tiny house movement is as much a manifestation of counter-cultural values as a preference for a specific dwelling type. This helps position tiny houses in the broader contemporary Australian housing market, enable preliminary international comparisons and allow some speculation about future trajectories. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",counter-culture; housing affordability; subcultures; tiny house movement; Tiny houses; tiny houses on wheels (THOW),affordable housing; cultural influence; housing market; housing policy; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101868293,1

Housing adjustment theory suggests that housing mobility results from experiencing normative housing deficit due to a discrepancy between housing priorities and housing conditions. A major factor in changing housing priorities is increasing monthly income. However, many renters continue to live in the same long-lease rental accommodation. A case study in a high-density Jakarta slum investigates increasing monthly incomes, changing housing priorities and the implications for housing mobility. Regression and descriptive analyses demonstrate that increasing monthly incomes and changing housing priorities do not lead to housing mobility because of strong social ties among slum inhabitants. Instead, renters mutate conventional intra-migration patterns with distinctive characteristics and housing priorities.

Embracing a historical institutionalist approach, alongside novel data and methodology, this paper assesses the variegated patterns of sectoral decline and resilience in these three northern European countries. We find the Danish, association-based model - with its polycentric governance and multi-level system of financing - to have been the most robustly resilient hitherto. In the UK and Sweden, we observe patterns of decline and evidence that the non-profit and needs-based principles which traditionally underpinned these systems have reached precarious thresholds.

In addition, we examine how these relationships are moderated in situations where policy is a prime cause of neighbourhood change through state-led regeneration. Across deprived areas, perceptions of social mix are positively associated with residential satisfaction, community cohesion, and feelings of empowerment and safety. Perceptions of ethnic diversity are positively associated with empowerment and safety, and negatively with area reputation. In regeneration areas, perceived social mix is positively associated with most outcomes but perceived ethnic mix holds negative associations; neither appears to impact external reputations. © 2023 The Author(s).

There has been a concerted attempt to make state organisations, and those in receipt of public funds, more entrepreneurial and financially proactive and independent. This paper focuses on one manifestation of these wider trends - the regulation of English Housing Associations [HAs] as examples of organisations that are under pressure to take on more financial risks and deliver a wider range of affordable housing for communities in need. Drawing on in-depth qualitative research, the paper assesses some of the regulatory and governmental challenges that emerge in using market-led forms of coordination. It examines the role of new regulators and the ways which they seek to ‘co- produce’ regulations with HAs in more liquid and negotiated ways. We show that in reality decisions are taken in response to a polycentric mix of simultaneous regulatory pressures that act as gravitational pulls on the activities and decisions made by HAs, rather than enforcing a consistent and linear form of regulatory control.

The latest example is the 2015 Nepal earthquake reconstruction effort. Although an impressive amount of house rebuilding did occur, more and more families have rebuilt their homes as one-room or one-storey earthquake-safe abodes that barely fulfil family needs. In this paper, inspired by Lefebvre’s ‘production of space’ concept, I discuss how ODR has changed building construction in rural Nepal. I also argue that ODR followed a ‘trendy’ donor-preferred housing reconstruction strategy without seriously taking into account the implementation issues, particularly the paucity of effective approaches to mobilize people to rebuild their houses. Through a critical review of previous ODR cases and my ethnographic study of the Nepal earthquake, I find that five key elements of successful ODR practices are missing. These are organizational structure of reconstruction institution, technical support, public-private partnerships, policy communication, and support for vulnerable groups. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2015 Nepal earthquake; disaster governance; owner-driven approach; Post-disaster housing reconstruction; public-private partnership; vulnerability,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145693273,0

This paper provides insights on whether loss aversion, in relation to the locational attributes of housing alternatives, affects the preference for alternative housing choices of older people. We propose an extended framework to measure symmetric as well as asymmetric valuation of losses and gains by an individual. The framework is applied in a discrete choice model based on a stated choice experiment with 440 Dutch home owners in the age group of 65 - 75 years. We find clearly that the current living situation (reference) affects the housing choice behaviour. Among other things, we find a general aversion to changing the type of location for almost all possible moves between city, suburban and town.

Turning to practice within organisations tackling homelessness, we then present evidence on how support can be explicitly, or inadvertently, discriminatory while trying to be well-intentioned. Evidence from an organisation that has embedded LGBTQ + inclusion into its services offers a best practice alternative.

Drawing on in-depth interviews with homeless LGBTQI+ youth in Ireland we offer a queer consideration of the structural challenges and agentic potentialities of young people’s housing pathways. Building on these young people’s experiences of becoming, being and leaving homelessness our queering process focuses on three phenomena: queer temporalities, queer liminalities and queer kinships. We argue that due to their evolving sexualities and gender identities ‘housing and home’ have distinctive meanings for LGBTQI+ youth. These meanings prioritise safe, non-homophobic/transphobic spaces, in which they can be themselves without the pressure to conceal their evolving identities or conform to heteronormative expectations. We suggest these meanings inform pathways into, through and out of homelessness and may contribute to higher rates of homelessness among LGBTQI+ youth.

Based on a prefecture-level panel dataset (including 290 Chinese cities) from 2009 to 2017, the empirical analysis reveals an uneven landscape of public housing provision significantly associated with the local government-driven land-based development and the time horizon of the city leaders’ current tenure. The empirical results suggest that the level of public housing provision is not only negatively impacted by the degree of land finance but also influenced by the industrial-sector-biased land supply strategies.

Our analysis reveals the increasing relevance of institutional actors as (co-)owners, which goes hand in hand with declining holding periods. As local actors are highly diverse, we have identified five types of actors and four commodification strategies, pointing towards a spatially differentiated division of labour. This actor constellation, dominated by micro actors, suggests that the specific situation and regulation of a market brings different types of actors to the fore. Most of the identified actors, and particularly the funding of their projects, have no relation to financial markets and sources; from this perspective, the concept of commodification provides greater insight into the dynamic of this specific housing market segment than the lens of financialisation does. © 2022 The Author(s).

In response, FEMA provides Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) to victims of housing loss. However, the extent to which sheltering needs are met by TSA has not been investigated, especially among low-income households. Analyzing FEMA’s administrative data including all damaged housing units in Harris and Galveston counties (N = 283,085), we found that low-income victims of housing loss not only had greater sheltering needs but also were less likely to access TSA than their counterparts not of low-income status. When both groups were in need of shelter, the chance of obtaining TSA for low-income victims of housing loss was much lower than that for their counterparts. Our study highlights the critical sheltering needs of low-income households in a natural disaster, and advocates for a broader and more equitable distribution of TSA. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Disaster; emergency shelters; homeless; low-income; needs assessment,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143423092,1

Our research finds that, although certain individual characteristics such as age, sex and origin remain relevant in explaining housing pathways, these factors are strongly mediated by the role of NGOs and support networks, and by the structural features of the asylum system and housing market.

However, in response to declining housing affordability and high land and development costs, various national governments are now introducing tax-based housing incentives to promote affordable housing production by private actors. Understanding the broader implications of this shift to tax subsidy and private investment, this review reflects on the market outcomes of arguably the most documented tax-based housing program in the Western world: the low-income housing tax credit program (LIHTC) in the United States. Although LIHTC remains a unique and distinctive instrument, some valuable lessons can be learned from it. In comparative terms, the program offers stricter affordability requirements than its counterparts introduced in countries like Australia, Chile, Colombia, France and Germany. Furthermore, it is accompanied by stronger regulations to commit investors and developers to the housing cause on a more long-term basis. However, despite potential benefits, tax-incentivized housing production does not necessarily result in efficient or equitable housing solutions. In non-American contexts, its increased importance coincides with the emergence of market-oriented social welfare systems where affordable rents are set higher and where tenure is more flexible and heterogeneous. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",affordable housing crisis; affordable housing finance; Fiscal instruments; housing affordability; housing privatization; LIHTC,,Review,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141022428,0

This paper compares rental housing politics in Los Angeles (USA) and Berlin (Germany) between 2008-2020 by examining how political processes influenced policy. It serves as a case of the emergence, escalation, and impact of tenant power. Tenant movement organizations employed five mechanisms to affect policymaking: (1) making demands, (2) forming coalitions, (3) promoting referendums, (4) engaging government officials in dialogue, and (5) transferring agents to government. The paper draws on multiple data sources, including interviews and participant observation over ten years. The cities witnessed policy episodes with four parallel characteristics: (1) locally progressive and regionally moderate, (2) shifting from defensive to offensive, (3) shifting from particular to universal, and (4) signs of a breakthrough beyond neoliberal housing policymaking. The findings suggest that the rise of tenant movements and their allies help drive policy change via multiple channels, exhibiting both similarities and differences across cities, especially in terms of money power and people power. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Berlin; Housing policy; Los Angeles; rental housing; tenant movements,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85139569436,0

In existing analyses, this figure is often a subjective value determined by homeowners. Little is known about the validity of using this type of data as a substitute for market value in inequality studies. Therefore, this paper aims to examine whether self-reported home values can be applied to evaluate housing wealth inequality. In order to achieve this goal, first, a theoretical framework on the irrelevance of valuation bias for the assessment of housing wealth inequality was developed, followed by an empirical analysis. The latter included gathering information on subjective flat values and their characteristics in Warsaw. Next, a geographically weighted regression was calibrated to calculate the market value of these dwellings. Then, using the Gini coefficient, housing wealth inequality levels were estimated separately for subjective and objective home values. The results revealed that the former could serve as a very good proxy for the latter in housing wealth inequality analysis. The findings hold across almost all identified subgroups based on respondents’ gender, age, income, wealth, education and employment status. Finally, recommendations were formulated for public institutions and housing research. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Geographically weighted regression; housing wealth inequality; subjective and objective measures; Warsaw housing market,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85139174060,1

Housing price level and growth decrease the household’s enthusiasm of purchasing a new house, while sentiment is positively related to the housing purchase intention.

The reasons for addressing vacancy are manifold, ranging from mitigating urban blight to mobilising latent resources in tight markets. Little attention is paid to vacancy in municipal housing strategies. Still, mapping vacant units appears to be complex and resource-demanding, likely discouraging municipalities from planning further operations against vacancy. Given the lack of methodological support in the literature, this paper discusses how to identify housing vacancy units. Through a case study in Wallonia (Belgium), this paper highlights the benefits of combining visual surveys and processing data provided by utilities and registered addresses.

We used data from the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment (1994–2010) with a 10- to 15-year follow-up period and used an innovative and multidimensional measure of neighbourhood opportunities for children. Compared with controls in public housing, MTO voucher recipients experienced improvement in neighbourhood opportunity overall and across domains during the entire study period, with a larger treatment effect for families in the MTO voucher group who received supplementary housing counselling, than the Section 8 voucher group.

Although the psycho-social effects of housing affordability stress are well documented there is a lack of research on their variation within or between cohorts who have shared experiences of housing (social generations). This article fills that gap by following 14,000 Australians in the national Household, Income and Labour Dynamics survey for 16-years as they enter and exit unaffordable housing. We model when cohorts seem most vulnerable to mental health effects of unaffordable housing. We find contemporaneously that while people born in the 1980s have a high likelihood of falling below the affordability threshold, older people have a lower likelihood of recovering. These trends create a ‘pinch point’ for this older generation with negative mental health consequences. We position housing affordability stress as an indicator of precarity whose mental health effects may vary both within cohorts and between generations as a product of their shared experiences of housing. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",generational cohorts; housing affordability stress; Mental health,affordable housing; homeownership; household survey; housing market; mental health; vulnerability; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136198904,0

Drawing on discourse analysis in conjunction with historical-institutional analysis of housing policy trajectories and the place of housing within political-economic change, it shows how territorial stigmatization can be understood as the product of media, policy and social scientific discourses which problematize public housing as well as histories of policy reform and political-economic restructuring which shape its social, material and institutional conditions. The discursive problematization of public housing estates in particular works to obscure the role of restructuring and reform and thus present demolition and redevelopment as a ‘common sense’ response, even as a form of destigmatization. The understanding of stigmatisation that this article advances—as a recursively symbolic and political-economic process—is therefore conceptually significant and important for critically evaluating government interventions in the context of stigma, including claims of destigmatization. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",discourse; estate renewal; public housing; social housing; Territorial stigma,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85135882991,0

I argue that trans and queer communities provide extensive, often exhausting, practical, material and emotional support which counters well-established queer exclusion within statutory services. I show that community support is critical to the survival of homeless trans people within a complex and unwelcoming system, and that informal crisis alternatives are enabled by idealism, hope and pragmatism.

The impact of ‘period effects’ are largely unknown. Using Dutch register data, we compare the probabilities of moving in view of partnership, children and employment status for 2012–2014 and 2014–2016. We find that the downturn period is associated with lower mobility, yet the association is different for various household situations. Mobility to ownership in the crisis was particularly constrained for stable couples, employed owners and households with children. Moves to the rental sector were less period sensitive. Only owners who became unemployed were more likely to move into rental during crisis. ‘Delayed mobility’ has been found for moving in together, separation, households who had children, and job change. So, periods of crisis and recovery structure how home-owners adapt to life-course changes.

During Soviet times, housing was given and owned by the state and the post-Soviet period was the time of ‘neighborhood reassembling’ when this Soviet housing stock was privatized and habituated by different social groups. Вased on Raymond Williams’ (1997) distinction between residual and emergent cultures the gentrification in two post-industrial neighborhoods was shown. The post-Soviet transitions included the emerging culture of the global middle classes replacing or co-existing with the authentic residual culture of the Soviet industrial working class. The analysis of the Soviet housing stock (i.e. structure level) and the meanings of its habituation (i.e. agent level) discovers class differences: workers habituated it as part of their everyday life, while the creative group views it as part of their Soviet heritage. The Soviet housing stock, as a cultural ‘residue’, constituted the dynamics of class relations while the identities within groups are blurred. This article highlights the theoretical debate that identities and housing are not about structures or agents but are intertwined. Housing as a symbol of a class is produced by policy makers, while housing habituated by residents is re-signified. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",gentrification; identities; Material culture; post-industrial neighbourhoods; Soviet housing,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85135534301,1

Qualitative interviews were undertaken with gated and non-gated residents in a case study area and the theories of Schutz and the lifeworld were drawn upon to understand the data collected. Findings reveal limited social interactions between the populations and significant physical, social, and symbolic divisions, accentuated by the transient character of the condominiums. Thus, condominiums built in residential areas do not appear to encourage social-tenurial mix.

Well-used concepts of property rights and tenure or de jure occupancy are expanded to incorporate more nuanced measures of de facto occupancy, particularly relating to the family economy in which we argue represents a form of diffuse informality not well captured in national data collections based on tenure alone. Applying this conceptualisation within an Australian survey of more than 2,870 individual renters within the informal-formal market, we find that informal renting within families is pervasive.

Despite differences, these contributions focus on housing as a component of a nation’s economy and the role of political institutions as managers of that system. Our goal is to help assess the value of emerging discussions that focus on the centrality of housing assets to ideas of class and the structuring of social opportunity. We identify four key elements of such approaches: first, a concern with changes within capitalism since the GFC; second, an interest in the continued role of the State; third, the ideological position of housing and tenure; and, finally, a concern with the class-tenure antagonisms that feature in many urban settings. We argue that while an emerging body of work now examines the role of housing assets in shaping class-based fissures there remains a need to consider the policy histories affecting the shifting position of particular tenures. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",capital; homeownership; housing classes; housing tenure; Political economy of housing,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134684887,0

However, with the emergence of capital, work spread more and more in the city, abandoning the dwelling due to new dynamics of mass production and accumulation that were no longer suited to the small scale of the house. It resulted in a gradual rethinking of domestic spaces, leading to the definition of the established duality of home/work. Instead, the digital revolution and the advent of capital’s ‘immaterial work’ in western countries placed the domestic space as the potential epicentre of capitalist production. Immaterial work is not bound by spatial constraints and can therefore be carried out anywhere, even and especially at home. The insertion of production dynamics within the domestic sphere is generating numerous spatial-temporal conflicts of traditional places and functions, leading to new everyday life and new spatial needs. The paper therefore analyses the changing dynamics of the home and its spatial possibilities emerging from the potential merge of immaterial productivity with domesticity. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",digital labour; Domesticity; immaterial labour; late capitalism; productive house,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134599175,0

Results showed that both the level and growth rate of house prices lowered homeowners’ levels of depressive symptoms and the effects were strengthened by upward trends of house prices, but the rise in house price growth rate was associated with a higher level of depressive symptoms in renters. There was no evidence to support the idea that the effect of house prices varied in relation to unrealized house value appreciation or depreciation. Results reveal the mediating role of physical activity and house value in the relationship between house prices and depressive symptoms in homeowners, supporting the wealth effect theory. However, the rise in both the level and the growth rate of house prices was related to a lower level of perceived social status, which in turn was correlated with a higher level of depressive symptoms. Contrary to the socioeconomic effect theory, the level of house prices is positively related to the expenditure on urban construction and maintenance, which is correlated with a higher level of depressive symptoms in homeowners.

Yet the political dynamics shaping post-crisis efforts to de-financialize housing have received surprisingly little analysis. The financialization literature posits that de-financialization policies have been hampered by a policy consensus on the desirability of the pre-crisis status quo. I examine this claim through a detailed analysis of Dutch macroprudential policy reforms, which aimed to mitigate housing-related systemic risks. It finds a fragmented rather than coherent policy community, with the central bank and financial conduct authority pushing for ambitious policies. While they influenced reforms during the housing bust (2008–2013), the government ensured that these financial supervisors would remain peripheral to the future determination of these policies. As the subsequent housing market recovery reduced the urgency to reform, supervisors were unable to impose further de-financialization policies. Housing financialization thus appears self-sustaining, by making mortgage-related policies politically too important for the government to consider a significant empowerment of the actors that might challenge it. © 2022 The Author(s).

Responding to these, we analysed 31 narrative interviews and survey data on Czech young adults (aged 18–35), providing unique evidence from a country where access to the housing market is significantly, albeit gradually, worsening. Our focus is on who they ascribe responsibility for housing provision, demonstrating how their strong calls for state intervention intermingle with a belief that individual solutions to the housing crisis are still possible. We illustrate how this ambivalent dual responsibilization is overcome through a complex interplay between moralities, rationalities and, importantly, through reference to emotions and the practices of intergenerational transfers which normalize the attachment to existing housing practices, ideologies and responsibilities. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",ambivalence; Housing crisis; meritocracy; responsibilization; young adults,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85132850212,0

We argue for the necessity of planned maintenance approaches as an essential component of sustainable housing, both to extend the life of housing assets and to ensure householder health and wellbeing. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",environmental health; healthy housing; housing quality; Indigenous housing policy; Maintenance; sustainability,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85131832837,0

Female-headed households compete for limited housing options with other households with varying socio-economic capacities. As a result, women have to choose from several housing pathways, utilising available social capital that occasionally covers inadequate financial resources. This may sometimes lead to social conflict and exploitation by landlords and brokers. This article seeks to understand the influence of women’s social capital and networks on pathways that female-headed households pursue in Kampala city. Using a snowball sampling strategy, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and document analysis, the article explores female-headed households’ pathways for housing options. Participants (n = 40) in this study were identified from the Katwe informal settlement of Kampala city. Findings indicate that the strength of social ties generated through; family attachments, friends, and socio-economic involvement influences female-headed household pathways. To a lesser extent, the use of informal brokers also may influence housing pathways. The article calls for specific legislation and guidelines to regulate the informal brokerage practice and professionalise the client-broker relationship.

We investigate how The Salvation Army (TSA), a local service provider on the estate since 2001, were used to enable relocation. Adopting a conceptual framework centred on the idea of ‘care’, we reveal three interconnected themes. First, we argue that presence of TSA on the estate is a form of local service provision based on a foundation of long-term ‘caring with’ tenants to build community and address disadvantage. Second, these long-term ‘caring with’ relationships transitioned into a form of ‘caring for’ within the context estate regeneration and forced tenant relocation.

In this study, we used content analysis methodology to assess features of 226 photographs accompanying stories about homelessness from U.S. news media outlets in 2019.

There were ambiguous definitions of ‘households’ associated with collaborative housing communities when interpreting the lockdown rules to provide mutual aid and support. Shared values, commitments and length of time of establishment mattered when operationalising such support. Moreover, the lockdown helped some communities re-evaluate their governance structures, decision-making and the limits of mutual support as they experienced what changing care needs of individual members meant to their communities.

Methods: We conducted a grounded analysis of these processes using qualitative interviews with 27 supportive housing residents in Miami. Results: Even after moving into supportive housing, many of our interviewees grappled with long-term impacts of trauma, discrimination, and stigma, which oftentimes prevented them from joining conventional congregations. While some turned to solitary prayer, others used strategies such as joining alternative congregations, creating new locations of practice, and using technology to sustain social ties and a sense of belonging.

Despite its contribution to labour mobility and productivity, Ghana’s public housing conditions are poor largely due to ineffective management and maintenance. The paper aims to use systems theory to identify the organizational challenges for management that has resulted in poorly maintained public housing.

This article explores the shifting relationships between wealth inequality, welfare states and household risk, focussing on the roles of housing and mortgage markets. We show national regimes of capitalism continue to shape experiences of risk, but increasingly through asset-based welfare mechanisms, centred on housing ownership, that are inadequately captured in existing comparative literature. Using OECD data, our argument is developed in two steps. First, we demonstrate that national patterns of wealth inequality do not follow classical welfare state categories, but mean wealth levels do, suggesting a distinct structural relationship. Second, we connect wealth inequality to the risks of housing ownership and household debt, focussing on house price falls in the United States, Italy and Denmark following the 2007–2008 financial crisis. We find mortgage default rates reflect welfare state categories rather than measures of financial risk, revealing an emerging ‘hybrid’ role of social insurance in supporting household liquidity. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",financialization; Housing; inequality; risk; wealth; welfare state,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129171324,1

Drawing on research into the management of social housing waitlists in Australia, we show how this problem space is characterised by a preoccupation with finding ever more fine-grained ways of targeting social housing to the neediest households in the context of growing scarcity of housing stock. Defining and operationalising ‘neediness’ becomes the focal point for policy making and struggles thereover, overshadowing questions of supply and broader debates about the role of social housing in addressing the housing crisis.

Recently, the capability approach to justice has attracted the attention of housing scholars, as promising guidance to compensate for problems in conventional policy approaches. However, the practicality of its policy application remains uncertain. This article suggests how to manage the issues creating gaps between the philosophy of the capability approach and housing policy practices, along the chain of essential questions of justice theories (which ideal institutions, metrics of justice, and distributive pattern rules?). Building on this reasoning, the article proposes that housing policy be guided by the changes in unjust housing situations in terms of people’s capability for housing, instead of by absolute principles of distribution, or characteristics of welfare state/housing regimes. For evaluating housing capability, this article proposes to assess housing opportunities, housing securities and housing abilities.

Prior studies, however, tend to overlook the political and institutional mechanisms that influence the practices and outcomes of social mix. Building on fieldwork in a former working-class municipality in Paris suburbs, I draw on the theory of gradual institutional change to examine the politics of social mix. I show that evolving power relations among housing policy actors, fostered by political alignment and multiple office-holding processes, pave the way for gradual institutional changes based on conversion. These modifications to the local institutional arrangement shape new directions in housing policy that lead to the restructuring of the built environment and neighbourhood socioeconomic ascent.

We show a negative association between new housing production and increased social mix; however, those living in new housing in higher income neighborhoods tend to have lower incomes than those living in older housing and vice versa in lower income neighborhoods.

The level of interactions with global factors reached the lowest during the transitional period between CMPP and the unconventional monetary policy period (UMPP). By contrast, the co-movements with global stock market factors had played a bigger role in explaining Hong Kong’s housing price variations during UMPP, especially at the time when the US, UK, EU, and Japan deployed QEs and/or negative interest rate policy.

The concept of precarity captures the economic importance of housing for financial well-being and security, as well as the non-economic functions of home as an emotional conduit for belonging, ontological security and mental health. © 2022 The Author(s).

Their development, based on a systematic use of financial valuations in their governance, strongly connected with international investor requirements, enables us to defend an extended notion of financialisation of housing policies, characterised by the colonisation of managers’ activities by financial metrics. The question of trust in financial numbers is essential when splitting the sector into two groups that occurred with the crisis: some developers worked even closer to investors, while others substantiated public economic power, balancing investors’ demands. The argument is that the entanglements between the circulation of financialised valuations in professional activities of private agents gradually transformed the structure of housing provision itself. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Financialisation; global South; housing; real estate developers,developing world; housing finance; housing management; housing policy; housing project; market development; Brazil,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124152739,0

In this paper, CH refers to housing projects where residents choose to share certain spaces and are involved in the design phase. While many authors point to the alleged economic benefits of living in CH, the (collaborative) design dimension is rarely mentioned in relation to affordability. This paper seeks to fill this knowledge gap by identifying design criteria used in CH to reduce building costs, increasing this way its affordability. We carry out a comparative case study research, where we assess the design phase of 16 CH projects in different European cities. Findings suggest that collaborative design processes increase the chances of improving housing affordability, mainly due to the often-applied needs-based approach and the redefinition of minimum housing standards.

What does a more nuanced understanding of assemblages—drawn from the original work of Deleuze and Guattari—have to offer housing studies to move beyond such dichotomies? This paper outlines a conceptual framework where housing is re-thought as an unfolding of socio-material processual-relations and desires forming a field of intensities. This theoretical framework is used to think through empirical findings from a six-month socio-spatial ethnography conducted in Karail, the largest informal settlement in Dhaka that houses 300,000 people. The findings, seen through assemblages, allow identifying, firstly, the interconnections between different actors across different binaries that make it work and secondly, the different modes of settlement’s production itself. Lastly, the paper recasts the settlement as a manifestation of a landscape of intersecting desires in an effort to speak of housing in a new language transcending the stifling dichotomy of top-down/bottom-up. © 2022 The Author(s).

Experiences of families moving to five peripheral settlements indicate two linked challenges to the social and economic mobility of the peripheralised urban poor: first, their immediate and individual ability to be mobile within the city and second, the longer-term social mobility of their households. While trajectories towards secure urban citizenship for all remain a policy aspiration, housing policies and practices are placing this on hold or even reversing this, with mobility constraints locking many low-income groups into marginality. © 2021 The Author(s).

By thus considering housing beyond conventional dichotomies–Global South vs. Global North, informality vs. formality, global vs. local–we may acquire a more nuanced understanding of those manifold forms of urban engagements that make housing a way of establishing a sense of order and belonging by activating often contradictory moral orientations and hierarchies of value. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",economy; Housing; Maputo; spectacular speculation; value conversions,housing market; investment; urban housing; valuation; Maputo [Mozambique]; Mozambique,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107874387,0

The introductory section establishes the framework for the paper, providing an overview of homelessness and the homemaking literature. Strengths in the homemaking approach are identified, which reconceptualises homelessness as a human-centered phenomenon that can be understood as ‘resistance’ to societies that block accesses to mainstream housing for people who are (also) socially and economically marginalised. Homemaking moves beyond mainstream academic analyses which explore homelessness in terms of ‘sin’ (addiction and criminality), ‘sickness’ (poor health, especially poor mental health) and ‘systems’ (housing market failure and inadequate social protection and public health systems). The paper argues that, while important in refreshing our thinking about homelessness by offering a new, radical epistemology of housing, homemaking is limited by not contextualising the dwelling practices it seeks to explain, particularly in respect of how it defines ‘homelessness’ and also risks misinterpreting transitory behavioural adaptations as something deeper. © 2021 The Author(s).

While some scholars and policy makers regard such displacement as having harmful outcomes in relation to loss of homes and community relations, others argue that residents benefit from relocation as they move to ‘better places’. This paper contributes to this debate, and to the wider 'post-displacement' research agenda, by providing an experiential perspective on residential relocation with reference to in-depth interviews with social housing residents in London who returned to new-build flats at the redeveloped mixed-tenure estates. The paper employs a multi-scalar approach to place attachment which is illustrated and analysed at three spatial scales: domestic (home/dwelling), intermediate (block of flats) and neighbourhood (estate). The home scale is the most positive albeit not unequivocal aspect of residents’ post-displacement experiences, whereas place attachments at the block and neighbourhood scales are characterized by extensive and intensive disruptions and losses. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Displacement; gentrification; home; neighbourhood; place attachment; regeneration; social housing estates,displacement; gentrification; residential location; social housing; tenure system; England; London [England]; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103148592,0

The findings demonstrate that first-time users are over two times more likely to exit into newly acquired housing than recurrent users, and that the pathways into and out of homelessness vary significantly between the two groups. The findings suggest that the composition of existing prevention strategies do not sufficiently meet the needs of first-time users experiencing financial and substance use challenges.

The paper is based on findings from an [Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute-funded research project]. Analysis suggests that private market rental subsidies work well in some areas and not so well in others, depending on local housing market conditions. In some cases, women have returned to violent situations because they perceive no alternative.

Existing studies analysed the influence of institutional and market factors on multiple home ownership, but few examined the changes in institutional factors. The present study aimed to address this research gap and found that households with local hukou, better occupational status or working in units of the party, government or state institutions are more likely to own multiple homes. Furthermore, the study investigated the impacts of institutional factors on multiple home ownership. Changing influences of institutional factors due to progressive reform were noted. Market reform reduced the influence of household registration and work units, whereas the effect of occupational status persists owing to incomplete reform. Progressive reform can lead to asymmetric changes in the role of institutional factors, supporting the coexistence of competing market transition theory and power persistence theory.

We employ hitherto underused local survey data (N = 17,803). Although permanent contracts are still dominant, the majority of young adults aged 18–23 are renters with a temporary lease. Students, those with a Western migration background, those who moved because their previous rental contract was terminated or because the previous dwelling was too expensive, and those who moved from abroad were particularly likely to have a temporary lease. Families were unlikely to have a temporary lease.

Participants were 11 refugees and asylum seekers who participated in a photovoice exercise, taking photographs of their housing and neighbourhood and then discussing these in an interview, with verbal data analyzed thematically. Participants identified several elements of housing that affected health, specifically the following: gardens, physical condition, space, layout and privacy and, in relation to neighbourhood, safety, green spaces and proximity to services. Cutting across these themes were affordability, security of tenure and agency which in turn affected ontological security.

Developing a framework inspired by the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, we aim to understand what kind of psycho-spatial arrangements of home-making are involved in establishing ontological security. Based on empirical research in Vancouver, BC, Canada, we suggest three modalities involved in home-making: the need for shelter as the most basic psychic relation to survival, the demand for housing as a psycho-social arrangement with the Other, and the desire for home as a psycho-spatial constitution in the fantasy. Through this, the paper calls for a deeper understanding of how the subject is inscribed actively and dynamically into their social and built environment. . © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Home; Housing; Jacques Lacan; Ontological Security; Psychoanalysis; Vancouver,empirical analysis; housing conditions; psychology; residential development; British Columbia; Canada; Vancouver [British Columbia],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097510126,0

We show that ownership plays an ambivalent role: on the one hand it may act to legitimise and (re)produce uneven power relations between family members, while on the other it mirrors or even supports mutual dependency and altruistic intergenerational and caring relations. To illuminate these issues, we structure our debate around three key topics: 1. ownership and the legitimisation of a dominant position, 2. ownership as a burden and a source of (in)security and interdependence, and 3. ownership as a commitment to care for the former owners.

My observations were indicative of deep fault lines in the make-up of the city space of many metropolis: between public and private space, between what home is for one person and a transit space for another, between defending the property rights of the train station and home making practices carving out shelter. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",home making; Homelessness; Paris,commodity market; homelessness; housing market; housing provision; management practice; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096621087,0

The main contribution of this paper is an articulation of ‘safe havens’ — districts designed as a harbor for global capital; a place of refuge during market uncertainty; and a place offering favorable conditions for capital growth. In New York, London, and Melbourne, luxury districts functioned primarily as investment vehicles to facilitate the circulation and expansion of capital after the financial crisis. Case studies draw upon census data, non-governmental and industry reports, academic studies, and local news sources and find that (1) capital funnelled into local housing through government incentivization; (2) vacancy increased in areas with rapid price rises; and (3) new investment zones were constructed to accommodate overflows of safe-haven demand and fuel recovery from the financial crisis. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",financialization; globalization; housing speculation; multiple property ownership; opportunity zone; Safe haven; transnational property investment,finance; financial crisis; globalization; housing market; investment; price dynamics; Australia; England; London [England]; Melbourne; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United Kingdom; United States; Victoria [Australia],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096326193,1

The overall decline in homeownership is even sharper along racial lines. The way race/ethnicity is captured in housing research has important implications for how racial disparities are explained and addressed. This paper uses a critical discourse analysis to examine how ethnicity and race are represented in New Zealand housing research published between 2013 and 2019. The analysis reveals a lack of attention devoted to explaining racial disparities in housing research. Only one article from a sample of 103 referenced the concepts ‘racism’ and ‘institutional racism’ to explain institutional barriers that adversely affect Indigenous people engaging with home-lending institutions. This paper argues that housing scholarship is an important space for understanding how policies institutionalize racism to exclude marginalized bodies, especially through predatory lending practices, loan denial, and segregation.

Using census microdata, we show that the middle classes face uneasy trade-offs between housing tenure and access to attractive educational resources. Living in high-quality school contexts is associated with renting, whereas access to homeownership mostly unfolds in poor-performing school areas. This tension is not observed for other social strata. Based on fieldwork conducted in Paris suburbs, we highlight the interweaving of middle-class housing and school choices. Some families may use the rental sector to live close to attractive schools. In mixed neighbourhoods, homeowners either choose the local school or opt for circumvention strategies. Because of the dramatic increase of housing prices, the interplay between housing tenure and the unequal geography of education is crucial to understand social stratification and social mobility patterns in large cities, particularly among the middle classes, as well as to improve public policies aimed at reducing housing and school inequalities. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",education; Housing tenure; inequality; middle classes; segregation,census; class; education; homeownership; metropolitan area; social mobility; social segregation; stratification; tenure system; urban housing; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096130111,1

Whereas legal and policy frameworks often equate home with house, unhoused people locate home in relationships, affects, routines and in time. In Leipzig shared shelters that are separated by sex are used to move as many people off the streets as possible. But to unhoused people home is first and foremost their relationships.

The framework identifies the mechanisms by which formal and informal housing markets are connected at the city-level, including competition, disamenity or negative spillover, and redevelopment or positive spillover. Informal housing in Mumbai serves as an empirical case to demonstrate the applicability of this framework. Results from field research suggest that the connection between formal and informal housing markets is dynamic–it can work in different causal directions, change over time and vary by scale.

However, the instability and structural constraints within which homeless people live can limit their ability to home-make. Hence, in this article, ‘place-making’ proved a useful alternative concept. This article draws on an ethnographic study in Scotland involving 22 young people and 27 staff who lived and worked respectively in a supported accommodation hostel. It demonstrates how the residents engaged in sensory practices within the tightly regulated confines of the hostel.

We then use a proforma-based approach to model the impacts of this combination.

Building on ‘new’ new economic sociology and a performative take on markets, the focus is on the social construction and the making of a market around this product. The transformation of housing into an investment product is examined by drawing on the advertising discourse, especially the VSW-market makers' webites. The negative effects of financialized housing production on the micro and urban level are also discussed. Against economic common sense, it is argued that the VSW market is not a ‘natural’ matter of a given demand and supply, but the product of a twofold social construction to which the Austrian state and the local banks make a significant contribution. What appears rational and advantageous from the investors’ individual point of view is, in various ways, a disadvantage for the urban community. . © 2020 The Author(s).

This article seeks to understand the changing school choice dynamics in gentrifying Amsterdam. Drawing on individual-level geocoded data, this article reveals the school choice of different groups of parents and how they are contingent on social class composition of their residential neighbourhood. It finds that different groups of parents enrol their children in different types of schools even if they live in the same neighbourhoods. This is in large part due to processes of disaffiliation and selective belonging from the part of ‘’white’ middle classes who choose specific schools within and outside of their neighbourhood. Yet, other groups of parents also have their children in schools outside of the neighbourhood thereby contributing to high levels of segregation too. Nonetheless, the article concludes that gentrification paradoxically leads to both greater concentration of highly educated and more mix in other schools. © 2020 The Author(s).

Using Australia as a case study, this policy review examines this sudden change in approach.

Using thirty-two semi-structured interviews with middle-income renters in New York City, this research analyses housing narratives to understand the financial and social complexities of remaining in place. Middle-income renters who are intentionally immobile explain how they stay in their neighbourhood area by making financial trade-offs and negotiating landlord relationships to avoid rent increases. Within a broader narrative of inevitable price displacement, this demonstrates how structural processes of urban housing and urban change manifest in the housing narratives of middle-income renters as they act to defer their own displacement and actively hold their place in changing neighbourhoods. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",immobility; Middle income; neighbourhood change; rent; residential mobility,affordable housing; household income; income distribution; neighborhood; residential mobility; trade-off; urban housing; urban population; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091758448,0

It argues that the ongoing housing transformation has altered the ‘classic’ features of compound houses, namely the dwelling unit, the use of shared space and the socio-demographic profile of households. It demonstrates that the physical transformation of compound houses predominantly involves the modification of dwelling units with shared facilities in compound houses into apartments where tenants have exclusive access to bathrooms, toilets, kitchens and electricity meters. Following such transformation, landlords obtain the rental power to capture at least 100 percent uplift in rents payable. There is evidence that the traditional form of housing that has, for many decades, provided shelter to low-income households is undergoing gentrification. The paper concludes by reflecting on the potential consequences of this transformation and makes a case for urgent policy intervention in the ongoing transformation of compound houses. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",compound house; gentrification; Housing transformation; Kumasi; rent gap,gentrification; housing; low income housing; rental sector; residential development; Ashanti; Ghana; Kumasi,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091690656,0

The good tenant demonstrates responsibility through paying rent on time and property stewardship (reporting repairs, making home). However, these practices are made necessary and risky through limited tenure security. The emotional and financial risks attending performances of the good tenant drive paradoxical relations; a good tenant is also acquiescent and silent, not reporting property repairs or lapsed leases to avoid rent increases and/or evictions.

The results indicate that the direction of the relationship between tenure type and the selected outcomes is largely similar across countries. Owners generally exhibit more desirable outcomes (including life satisfaction, civic participation, educational outcomes for children, and physical and mental health). However, when looking at the relationship between outcomes and country level differences in tenure length gap, findings suggest that renters have outcomes that are more similar to owners in countries in which tenure length gaps are smaller.

Unlike other critical approaches (i.e., critical discourse analysis) this perspective focuses on actors own critical capacity and it is argued that the approach is useful in analyzing re-politicizing efforts of social actors. The main finding is that most arguments opposing the regulation are based in the civic “regime of justification”, while arguments supporting the regulation are based in the industrial regime of justification. Few arguments enact the market regime as justification. The article discusses reasons why the regulation has not been repelled, despite the widespread criticism. © 2020 The Author(s).

Specifically, we document how much this racial disparity changed among renters over almost four decades and identify how much factors associated with income or housing costs explain Black–White inequality in exposure to housing cost burden. For White households, the net contribution of household, neighbourhood and metropolitan covariates accounts for much of the change in the probability of housing cost burden over time. For Black households, however, the probability of experiencing housing cost burden continued to rise throughout the period of this study, even after controlling for household, neighbourhood and metropolitan covariates. This suggests that unobserved variables like racial discrimination, social networks or employment quality might explain the increasing disparity in cost burden among for Black and White households in the USA. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cost burden; Housing cost; racial inequality,cost analysis; household expenditure; housing market; racial disparity; rental sector; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089868303,1

Different organizational models are being developed to enable groups of people to own and control housing collectively. The benefits of such models have been widely promoted, not least in terms of delivering enhanced housing affordability for residents. However, evidence to support such claims is scarce and it remains unclear whether affordability is the product of collective forms and functions, or some other factor(s). To address this gap in knowledge, the paper presents findings from three case studies of English and Canadian housing collectives. Applying realist theories of causation, the processes affecting housing affordability are explained, conceptualizing two causal mechanisms which depict how organizational form, internal rules and regulatory activity, along with the unique role of the resident-owner, influence the setting of rents and prices.

Housing affordability is commonly measured by either price-to-income ratio (PIR) or rent-to-income ratio (RIR), and the latter method is often found to be relatively stable over time and across countries. We contend that RIR cannot accurately reflect affordability situations because of the income elasticity of housing demand. Informal housing markets exist in Hong Kong for low-income households to pay lower and more ""affordable"" rent by living in units of smaller size and poorer quality, which are often with irregularities. This study found that SDU households have a relatively low income elasticity of housing demand and a relatively high RIR.

Our cointegration results show no evidence of cointegration between real house price and rent in the western region. However, there is strong evidence of cointegration in the eastern and northern regions. This confirms the existence of housing submarkets in Greater Sydney, and an indication of housing price bubbles in Western Sydney. Further, the formal BSADF bubble tests reveal strong evidence of explosive price bubbles in Western Sydney, while there is no comparable evidence for the other regions of Sydney, which further highlights the importance of submarket analysis. Importantly, the DOLS results suggest that housing investment plays a major role in the build-up of housing bubbles in Western Sydney, supporting Shiller's Psychological Theory of bubbles which posits that bubbles occur via the speculative behaviour of investors.

This empirical study explores socio-economic heterogeneity in the case of Swedish debtors in foreclosure between 2000 and 2014. Employing individual-level data, the study observes variability over time for socio-economic variables within and between three groups of debtors with mortgage, consumer, and tax debt, respectively. The results indicate that there were trends towards increasing socio-economic heterogeneity within these three groups and that these trends were particularly strong among the group with mortgage debt. For the mortgage debt group, a greater number of socio-economically weak debtors entering foreclosure over time drives increasing heterogeneity.

We contribute to the existing literature by addressing the distribution of the tax deductibility of mortgage loans considering the spatial outcomes of this policy. We use Belgian data to measure the impact of this policy on households' income and inequality and poverty in different types of areas. We show that this measure favours suburban households and subsidizes urban sprawl. Exogenous factors such as past housing policies and homeownership determinants play a key role in this phenomenon.

Unaffordable rents, insecure tenancies and poor-quality accommodation are emblematic of these contemporary insecurities. However, the experiences of such renters and their responses to housing hardships remain under-explored in the Generation Rent literature. Drawing on a qualitative study (n = 28) of renters from Dublin (Ireland), this paper examines the ways people develop coping strategies to respond to their housing difficulties, or at least minimise their adverse effects. The analysis shows that young renters are far from passive victims. Even though they faced significant pressures regarding housing affordability, security, quality and access, they worked hard to maintain their homes. The findings illustrate how people respond to difficult housing circumstances by adopting a range of expenditure, employment and housing-related responses.

Applying multilevel generalized linear latent and mixed logit models to unique, geocoded data from a choice experiment, it is demonstrated how heterogenous evaluations of the social and ethnic composition of available housing alternatives’ residential surroundings systematically vary with bespoke but not administrative neighbourhoods. These heterogeneous evaluations are mostly independent of respondents’ own social and ethnic background. Controlling for unobserved neighbourhood selection, however, removes the association with bespoke neighbourhoods’ composition. Nevertheless, even after accounting for unobserved selection processes, the evaluation of the social and ethnic composition of housing alternatives in the choice experiment systematically varies across bespoke neighbourhoods, pointing to unobserved neighbourhood influences that shape people’s residential preferences. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",choice experiment; Housing choice; neighbourhoods; residential preferences,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121571516,1

Compared with the Han majority, the Manchu have a higher probability of owning a home, whereas other ethnic groups are often associated with a lower homeownership rate. Observable socio-economic characteristics play a minor role in this ethnic homeownership gap, whereas most of them are attributable to unobserved factors, such as discrimination. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Blinder-Oaxaca-Fairlie decomposition; discrimination; Ethnic minority migrants; homeownership gap,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121373339,1

First, that housing benefit recipients are systemically excluded from listings on online flat-sharing websites through the construction of the “professional” prospective tenant. The UK’s much derided “No DSS” has evolved into a “professionals only” proxy. This is not confined solely to landlords and agents posting on the platform–it is also reflected by sitting tenants advertising spare rooms. Second, that the design of the SpareRoom.co.uk platform exacerbates this exclusion by facilitating the use of this “professional” construction. Through the design of inputs and built-in classifications within the platform, users posting listings are prompted to select from a finite list of housemate preferences, which in turn increases the number of listings adopting exclusionary practices. These findings have implications for research on low-income renters, “generation rent” and the role of online renting platforms. © 2021 The Author(s).

The influence of energy investments on housing values has been widely studied, with past research often finding a positive relationship. However, there is missing knowledge for the specific relationship between solar panels and housing rents. This study finds that Australian renters with solar panels pay approximately A$19 more in weekly housing rents than non-solar renters. The results suggest that landlords have been able to benefit from investments in solar panels through higher rent, with a payback period of around 5 years. The study provides context for policymakers across the world considering subsidies for solar panels on rental housing.

Drawing from Desiree Fields’ (2017a) work on urban struggles with financialisation, this conceptual argument is unpacked through a case study of post-crash Dublin, an urban space reshaped by housing financialisation and struggles resisting it. Housing has been a key subject of contention in post-crash Dublin and activists’ digital/material struggles illustrate how digital technologies and platforms can be and are appropriated to resist housing financialisation.

Although historical specificity discouraged aggressive gentrification, and legal regulations provided local governments with tools that helped ensure continuity of tenancy, revitalization results reveal a surprisingly high level of actual and planned displacement, as tenants decide to permanently leave their neighbourhoods. The study examines the issue of displacement in the context of housing conditions, characterized by a large share but low quality of public housing, and progressive regulatory environment. It describes the practical organization of resettlements in Łódź, their strengths and shortcomings, as well as tenants’ responses. It contributes to research on displacement by showing that revitalization-induced resettlement is positively valued in certain circumstances.

There are concerns that this housing stock is being lost from residential housing and exacerbates issues of housing equality. This paper undertakes a case study of Airbnb growth in London to examine changes in listings and provides insight into Airbnb hosts.

The article focuses on the space of expectation adjustment in a period of extended crisis in housing systems, fostering the ‘cruel optimism’ (Berlant, Cruel optimism (Durham, NC: Duke University Press), 2011) of persistent and collectively maintained attachments to outcomes which are increasingly unrealisable. First, individuals downgraded their own expectations of living space. Second, in negotiating wider societal expectations, individuals engaged in impression management to prevent stigmatisation. The research thus advances longstanding debates on housing and stigma.

Seldom do these studies contextualize these tendencies within countries’ specific housing policy traditions. Therefore, through a qualitative case study in a neighbourhood in Sweden, this paper aims to uncover how private landlords undertake renovations as an investment strategy and its effect on tenants and, in turn, on the hybrid character of a universal housing system. It finds that renovations enable landlords to extract value from the built environment while tenants experience rising rents, a lack of information, poor property maintenance, and apprehension. Hence, I argue that renovations represent an investment strategy that serves to undermine the traditional social right to housing within a universal housing policy context.

The absence of ownership, especially in terms of housing, co-creates the very idea of homelessness in current societies. Despite this fact, ‘homeless’ citizens negotiate and experience their property, things, or the shelter in which they dwell. This paper sheds light on how this property is negotiated and experienced and how it influences home-making. It does so by drawing on long-term ethnographic research in the city of Pilsen, a second-order city in Czechia. Based on the intra-urban comparison of informal dwelling in two abandoned buildings–a former railway station tower and an allotment cottage–the paper conceptualize the unspotted home and argues that it arises from the assemblage of socio-materiality, meanings, and various dimensions of politics, where the politics of home-ownership has an important position. While informal ownership here is related to power asymmetry within home-making, paradoxically, it also brings about more complex informal citizenship and the potential for political action. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",citizenship; home-ownership; Homelessness; informal dwelling; materiality; unspotted homes,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113815278,0

These predictions can be useful for assessing the rationale for attempts to use housing assets as a way of supplementing state pensions; and thus add to existing studies on asset-based welfare (ABW) that focused only on the recent and past situation. The models predicted small increase in housing wealth inequality among the future elderly but larger increases in inequality in the society as a whole. Rise in wealth inequality was especially steep when consumption of housing assets by future elderly was accompanied by an interruption of financial transfers to the next generations. Reduction of intergenerational transfers may thus significantly enhance wealth inequality in a society and thus pose a risk to social peace.

Results show that, after controlling for covariates, parental lending for housing would triple the adult children’s odds of homeownership. Parental financial support plays a marginal role in maintaining homeownership. Adult children are more likely to transfer income to their parents than to receive, which is detrimental to the adult children’s homeownership. The relative importance of PA is secondary to that of parental support and the adult children’s institutional attributes—hukou status and access to housing provident fund.

For each of them, the article first provides a brief recapitulation of the literature. It then explicates how they are constrained by the owning-renting dichotomy and why abandoning this dichotomy is necessary to transcend their limitations. Based on this, the article reveals a dialectical relation between owning and renting - the binary-oppositional attributes of owning and renting can be resolved with the changing relation of the occupant to financial markets. The article further proposes to re-conceptualize housing tenure as a relation of the occupant to financial markets and discusses the implications for reframing housing studies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",financialization; housing finance; Housing tenure; ideology; welfare state,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112149544,0

Almost twenty years later, the balance is striking: still 1,222 municipalities targeted by the program do not comply with the set quota of 25% social housing units per municipality. Out of these non-complying municipalities, 269 had to pay an increased fee in 2017, based on the Article 55 clause included in the SRU Law. The total fee that these ‘outlaw municipalities’ had to pay for not providing enough social housing represented a total of € 77 million in 2017, and helped finance the national rental social housing fund for housing. In this paper, I ask what impact the Article 55 fee clause designed to enforce SRU Law objectives has had on the rebalancing of social housing stocks for municipalities not complying with set quotas. To answer such a question, I conduct a Difference-in-Differences study that measures changes in social housing stocks before and after the passage of the law. The treatment group comprises municipalities not complying with quota requirements and subject to the Article 55 fee, while the control group consists of municipalities not complying with quota requirements, but exempt from the fee. Findings underscore how after the passage of the Article 55 fee, municipalities that were subject to the fee have built less social housing than municipalities that are exempt, relative to before the enactment of the law. They corroborate my conceptual framework, which states that beyond the adoption of a national fee for noncompliant municipalities, social housing production trends are impacted by the types of land use ideologies in place in municipalities, be they pro-social housing or exclusionary Twenty years later, these findings bring a new perspective to current debates taking place in policy circles around the effectiveness of one of France’s most important social housing policy programs. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",exclusionary practices; France; inclusionary zoning; social housing; SRU Law,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111919551,0

To elucidate the nature of this resistance, we interviewed experienced Chinese officials, practitioners, and scholars—who, inevitably, were themselves GC residents. They challenge the policy in two ways: policy-rejectors justify gating as common sense and stress risks of ungating, whereas policy-sympathizers understand the policy shift but doubt its feasibility. Their rationales reveal ingrained cognitive dissonance and entrenched state-society tension. Such sentiments that resist ungating collectively create practical and ideological barriers to mitigating housing segregation. China’s GCs showcase how private production of civic goods prioritizes market rules and promotes individual values.

This paper explores the relationship between housing conditions and well-being, using Nussbaum’s version of the CA as the basis for analysis. It draws on data from a UK-based qualitative study of the experiences of individuals residing in privately-run hostels in the North of England. The analysis reveals much diversity in terms of the ways in which the residents perceived their housing conditions and the impacts of these on their exercise of key functions, despite all living in similar environmental conditions. This highlights the highly subjective and complex nature of the relationship between housing conditions and well-being. It is argued that a more robust understanding of the key factors that mediate the relationship being investigated is needed if the potential of the CA to advance housing research and evaluation is to be further realized. © 2021 The Author(s).

Given the importance of housing for the elderly, one may expect many to be forced to dedicate ever-larger shares of their income to housing costs. Using longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), we examine how changes in housing costs between 1996 and 2017 have affected income poverty among Germany’s over-65s. Our results reveal that higher costs have indeed contributed to increased income poverty in old age in that period. Our pooled probit regression models as applied to Germany’s elderly show that increased housing costs mean tenants, homeowners with outstanding mortgages, single-person households and people with migration background all suffer a higher risk of poverty, while the risk remains lower for outright homeowners. Since the relative income position of the elderly is expected to further deteriorate in future, our study suggests a need for policy action to avoid a worsening in figures for old-age income poverty in Germany. © 2021 The Author(s).

The study employs an institutional lens to understand how formal and informal institutions shaped the implementation of projects and how key stakeholders acted upon conflicting incentives. It discusses five major factors–inadequate formal policy and regulatory framework, limited government capability and support, limited sector capacity, private finance reluctance and adverse informal arrangements–that caused serious difficulties both at the program and project level.

The mature market framework is developed by reference to investment theory and comparison with established PRSs in Europe. The PRS is accepted to a degree by users, the government, the wider community and investors. However, the PRS still lacks complete acceptance among tenants and fiscal changes have reduced its financial attractiveness to landlords. Recent Scottish legislation has brought greater regulation that has favoured tenants. There is also little evidence of acceptance by institutional investors. The study therefore finds the case for maturity is unproven, although some subsectors are more mature than others. From a housing system perspective PRS maturity is a function of how the state frames the interaction between private markets and public provision, particularly in countries like the UK which retain a significant sized social sector. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",market maturity; private landlords Edinburgh; Private rented sector; Rent regulation,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106529561,0

Much of the literature describes the state playing a role to promote the regulatory, legislative, and financial conditions needed to allow global financial capital to penetrate land and property markets. I build on these arguments to develop in what ways the state is playing an active role in housing financialisation in Turkey. I suggest that the Turkish national state has deliberately, actively, and forcefully pursued housing financialisation by (i) introducing new legislation; (ii) creating financial frameworks to encourage speculation by domestic and international capital on land and housing as assets (iii) enclosing public land and exploiting informal types of tenure; (iv) assetising land and housing by developing revenue-sharing urban regeneration projects; and (v) using coercive legal and penal force to criminalise informal development, and to quell resistance to state-led regeneration.

Focussing on Australia, this paper provides a critical historical analysis of how and why these interconnections limited reform. Despite the early 1970s being the highpoint of social democratic idealism, the new homelessness sector redeployed the methods of residual charity, largely because it was seen as a replacement for jail. The legal reforms were partial and, since their focus was limited to homeless white men, they had unintended consequences, tragically so for Indigenous peoples. While these shifts represented a turning point in the long governance of homelessness, they were ones in which old ways prevailed and, as neoliberalism gained ground, they became embedded in the policy landscape. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",decriminalisation; Homelessness; Indigenous people; public space; Skid Row; vagrancy,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106488913,0

This is different from the pattern in Western economies where households own multiple properties but still live in an owned unit. The paper is situated within the literature on the financialization of housing and the changing meaning of homeownership. We examine the paradox by studying its patterns and dynamics using 2017 China Household Finance Survey data. We find that the owner-renting in China is a result of spatial, temporal and functional mismatches between housing needs. The intrinsic investment strategy and services linked to homeownership have made it imperative to own homes, regardless a household’s housing needs. Young, single, better-off and split households, and those in large, expensive cities are more likely to be owners-renting. In addition, institutional barriers in the housing market such as migrant status, housing purchase limit policy, and subsidized housing encourage owner-renting. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",China; financialization; Homeownership; housing; rental housing; tenure,capitalism; homeownership; housing market; rental sector; tenure relations; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089252829,1

With a nod to Kemeny’s ‘The Really Big Trade-Off Between Homeownership and Welfare’, we demonstrate that there is also a ‘Really Big Contradiction’ between the discourses that support homeownership as the ‘normalized’ form of tenure in Belgium and the reality of declining affordability, progressively less conservative housing finance, the fractions and inequalities of housing-based wealth, and the lack of tenure neutrality.

To do so, it examines the cases of Ireland and Denmark and employs and develops the concept of ‘financial circuits’. This concept refers to dynamic flows of capital and revenue which move through the built environment in ways which are structured by the different funding streams which make them up, and by their interaction with the wider socio-economic context. The key insight offered here is that the cyclicality, permeability and breadth of financial circuits are key to understanding finance’s impact on the size and trajectory of the social housing tenure. The Danish social housing sector has doubled in size since the 1960s partially because it draws on broad financial circuits which consist of many different types of finance, including government, non-profit and financialised private sources. This insulates the sector from reductions in funding from any single source and avoids the boom/bust investment cycles common in Ireland where the sector relies almost entirely on government grants for funding. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",financialisation; residualisation; Social housing,financial system; housing market; investment; local government; social housing; trajectory; Denmark; Ireland,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086946606,0

Using 2007–2017 data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we study the impact of disability on ex-post delinquency rate and ex-ante self-assessed delinquency risk. We find that disability substantially increases a household’s likelihood of falling behind on mortgage payments. Our point estimates suggest that on average, households with disabilities are about 41.65 percent more likely to be delinquent. This effect is highly cyclical and is much stronger during economic downturns. Households with disabilities are 56.38 percent more likely to be delinquent during the 2007–2009 U.S. housing crisis and its aftermath, and whereas the effect is rather muted during the subsequent economic recovery. Additionally, we discover that households with disabilities are generally conscious of their greater vulnerability to financial troubles. Households with disabilities are 27.28 percent more likely to report possible future delinquencies. This finding suggests that in addition to increasing ex-post delinquency rates, disability can also be psychologically burdensome for many homeowners, and this effect spreads beyond households who actually fall into delinquency. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Credit risk; disability; I10; JEL Classification D14; mortgage delinquency; R31,disability; financial crisis; household income; mortgage lending; panel data; self assessment,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086942735,1

Consequently, they often rely on different forms of alternative housing arrangements. Such arrangements include prolonged sharing with friends and strangers, or moving back with parents.

First, real estate agents use the income criterion as a category to organize the worthiness of a rental applicant. Our comparative design shows that financial risk assessment depends on particular institutional features of national tenancy regulations. Second, a “good tenant” is more than just a financially-solvent one. A good tenant pays rent regularly, stays in the apartment, maintains it in good condition, and does not cause any trouble.

By the early 2000s, most company towns had been ‘normalised’, the mining industry had abolished the compound system and homeownership had become the dominant policy goal. We use evolutionary governance theory and the concepts of social disruption and place attachment to reveal two problems: the path dependency of the migrant labour system and the goal dependency of government policy. To illustrate the effects on the residents of a coal mining town, we identify three housing clusters: renters, homeowners and informal settlers. Using findings from a survey of one South African mining town (Emalahleni), we show how the housing system created by normalisation places undue pressure on municipal services. We argue that by ignoring the continued migration and the likelihood of mine decline or closure government policy is putting homeowners at risk. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cluster analysis; Coal mining; evolutionary governance theory; homeownership; migrant labour; place attachment,cluster analysis; coal mine; coal mining; homeownership; housing provision; migrant worker; post-apartheid; South Africa,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085965997,0

Rather, it has reinforced and rescaled itself, expanding into new market segments and urban territories. However, while academic scholarship has convincingly exposed the reconfiguration of financialization processes, it has paid surprisingly little attention to how these processes are also contested from within society and the economy. In response to this gap in the literature, I propose in this contribution a threefold research agenda, calling out for more research on (i) financial market reforms aimed at dismantling finance-led housing accumulation; (ii) policy focused on strengthening the public and affordable housing sector; and (iii) changing modes of urban governance and ‘anti-political’ social movements which can contest housing financialization locally. Taking into account these three fields of inquiry, I invite housing scholars to explore how–and if –de-financializing tendencies can become ecologically dominant in post-crisis urban housing markets. © 2020 The Author(s).

Responsibilization often requires welfare receivers to comply with specific duties or behavioural patterns (i.e. conditionality). Except for UK-based studies, little is known about responsibilization strategies of social housing tenants based on specific allocation policies or management approaches. To fill this gap, this paper examines recent cases of tenants’ responsibilization through conditionality, i.e. allocation of housing on the condition that receivers regularly engage in supportive activities, in Utrecht (The Netherlands) and Milan (Italy). Through a qualitative methodology, this paper unpacks the use of conditionality as a means to increase tenants’ responsibilization.

Our analysis shows that self-help housing is common in the United States, comprising approximately 10% of new owner-occupied single-family housing units nationwide and more than double that in rural areas across the country. We analyse home improvement activity for self-help and conventional homeowners, illustrating the incremental process by which self-builders improve their homes, widespread reliance on do-it-yourself (DIY) methods, and the impact of these methods on housing affordability.

This article examines whether rehousing, following this large-scale construction commitment, is associated with significant improvements in housing outcomes. People on the waiting list for social housing were recruited in 12 communities in Nunavik and Nunavut. Of the 186 adults who were rehoused, 102 completed the study. Questionnaires were administered 1–6 months before and 15–18 months after rehousing. After rehousing, household crowding, major repairs needed, and thermal discomfort were significantly reduced. The sense of home, including factors such as perceived control, privacy, and identity, improved significantly post-move.

On the one hand, facing the lack of specialist housing for the elderly, older people are incentivised to ‘age in place’; on the other, to move to smaller homes to free-up family housing, reducing pressure on housing supply. This ‘downsizing’ discourse is presented as a ‘win-win’ situation which benefits older people and the rest of society. However, a survey and interviews conducted with over 55 s in England reveals more nuanced patterns of residential moves, behaviours and aspirations than suggested by ‘downsizing’. Only a minority of older households choose to downsize. This paper looks into this mismatch between observed housing choices and the construction of downsizing as a policy goal. It suggests that theoretically speaking, the very notion of downsizing is problematic and difficult to define and is an over-simplistic concept which in reality applies to a heterogeneous group of people. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",ageing; Downsizing; housing; housing choice; older people; residential mobility; rightsizing,aging population; construction; elderly care; housing; residential mobility; England; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084137030,0

A growing number of studies have identified financial transfers within families as a means through which entry into the housing market is facilitated for young adults.

Living in permanent housing and having a case manager were related to lower ED use, fewer hospitalizations, and greater satisfaction with services. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cluster analysis; Emergency department; healthcare service use; persons experiencing homelessness; type of housing; typologies,accessibility; cluster analysis; health care; health services; homelessness; housing conditions; housing policy; housing provision; quality of life; Canada; Quebec [Canada],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083586126,1

The impact of such policies on households, however, is rarely acknowledged. Therefore, in this article, distributive effects on social housing tenants in Amsterdam between 2004 and 2014 are evaluated against two standards for distributive justice: sufficiency and priority. These standards befit the policy aim to provide adequate (sufficient) housing for households with a certain need (priority). The analysis shows housing policies have amplified the impacts of the global financial crisis on households. The occurrence of sufficiency increased significantly until 2008, but decreased thereafter. In regards of the priority standard more households with a significant need benefitted from social housing after 2008. However, many of these households still do not meet the sufficiency threshold. While spatial patterns remained rather stable, the impact has been greater in the areas with already relatively low residual incomes. © 2020 The Author(s).

This research reports on the demographics and housing conditions of single-family renters and the characteristics and trajectories of high SFR growth neighbourhoods over the recent housing market cycle. We show that SFRs are distinguished by their high prevalence of children, particularly those living in poverty, and conspicuous lack of tenant protections.

Based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork in the university town of Butare, I argue that educated town residents’ relationships to ‘home’ are a nexus of the genocide’s legacy, of the contingencies of lives not lived, and of post-genocide politics. Drawing from participant observation and interviews, I delineate four relationships between home, temporality, and genocide to elicit the broader tension between settlement and what remains unsettled in the wake of violence. Central to this tension is how seemingly private talk of home offers a powerful critique of the former colonizer, of the actors who planned the genocide, and of post-genocide social and political conditions. Butare residents’ relationships to house and home thus uncover the inherent contradictions in the idea that people ‘move on’ from violence by ‘settling down.’. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",genocide; home; Housing; post-conflict societies; Rwanda,ethnography; genocide; housing conditions; settlement planning; urban housing; violence; Rwanda,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080124576,0

Scarcely has research examined how cultural norms shape parents’ experiences of home in apartments. This paper responds by analysing experiences of 18 apartment-dwelling families in Sydney, Australia. Conceptual influences from emotional geographies reveal the work of making apartments home. While parents associate apartment living with lifestyle benefits, their sense of home is undermined by persistent questioning of parenting and housing choices. Contradictory experiences result in doubt about future capacities to make apartments home. Alongside uncertainty, parents feel guilty about ‘failing’ children through housing constraints and choices. Such experiences signal a need to rethink urban consolidation discourses, planning regulations and building design to better recognise the diversity of apartment residents. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cultural norms; Densification; emotion; home; parenting,conceptual framework; cultural relations; housing; lifestyle; psychology; suburban area; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078628539,0

Commentary and scholarly attention have generally focused on the population occupying this growing sector–so-called ‘generation rent’. The corollary, ‘generation landlord’, has meanwhile remained largely obscure. This article argues that the emerging literature on the ‘financialization of housing’ offers insights into the ongoing rise of investor landlords. Our analysis also contributes to the picture of financialized rental property investment; here drawing on a survey of investor landlords and their properties in an Australian PRS growth centre: disadvantaged suburbs in western Sydney. Most investors lived elsewhere; the attractions of western Sydney property acquisition being the expectation of unusually large capital gains, the prospect of amassing multiple properties and the local scope for intensified asset utilization. Referencing existing research evidence, this suggests that, even by comparison with the 2000s, a more professional, financialized investor mindset is emerging. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",housing market dynamics; private landlords; Private rental investment,economic growth; housing market; landholding; private land; property market; rental sector; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078590357,0

These arrangements are unusual in a Western European context because the capital costs of providing this housing are almost entirely covered by central government grants, rather than non-governmental debt finance as is the norm elsewhere. Furthermore, no housing allowances are provided to council tenants in Ireland; rather affordability is ensured by charging rents which are linked (progressively) to tenants’ incomes. Although the character and development of Irish council housing has of course been shaped by macro level political, ideological, social and economic factors, the argument offered here is that funding arrangements have also exerted a strong independent influence. These arrangements render Irish council housing more vulnerable to retrenchment and residualization than the social housing funding arrangements used in most other Western European countries. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",housing finance; Ireland; Residualisation; Social housing; Social housing management; social housing tenants,finance; housing market; incentive; local government; social housing; state role; tenure system; vulnerability; Ireland,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078413277,0

Using household-level data from urban China, we investigate how and why having sons and daughters differentially affects the household tenure choice of multiple homes. We found a robust and positive impact of having sons on multiple-home ownership. Having at least one unmarried son of marriageable age significantly increases a family’s consumption of and demand for additional homes. The results are mainly heterogeneous across families with different levels of intra-family resources.

Recent years have seen frequent protests that have highlighted problems in the Irish housing sector, along with the emergence of various housing movements, especially in Dublin, where the lack of affordable housing is severe. This paper argues that these campaigns have contributed to the increased public debate on commodified housing models, signalling a strong demand for a coherent and inclusive national housing policy in Ireland. In particular, I examine the activities of the Home Sweet Home movement (HSH), a collective organization of housing activists that occupied the Apollo House building in Dublin’s inner city in 2016–2017. This movement challenged private housing market solutions and the central role played by financialisation in economic and social life. Whilst considering that Ireland is suffering a housing crisis which cannot be easily solved, this paper combines a critical analysis of housing movements that resist neoliberal housing models, the HSH action in this context, and the challenges involved in changing the government’s approach to housing. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",activism; direct action; homelessness; Housing crisis; Ireland; social movements,homelessness; housing conditions; housing market; housing policy; neoliberalism; social movement; urban housing; Dublin [(CTY) Leinster]; Ireland; Leinster; Parnassius apollo,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076412824,0

Many were displaced by its demolition–redevelopment policy (forced movers); some chose to move voluntarily to improve their housing utility (voluntary movers); others decided to stay put in substandard housing (voluntary non-movers). A survey of their current housing conditions revealed that, compared to voluntary non-movers, most forced movers had not become better-off. But the voluntary movers had done much better than both of the other groups, implying that a timely move could have led to their improved housing conditions. However, even voluntary moves proved to have a downside, namely, that voluntary migrants would likely end up living somewhere more remote from coveted facilities and locations of jobs in the inner city. Logistic regression analysis showed how differences in socio-demographic characteristics between voluntary movers and non-movers could explain why some decided to move. For those who decided to stay, the analysis also indicates how the advantages of the current location may compensate for housing deficiencies. These results correspond to the motives migrants expressed in supplementary in-depth interviews: migrants intending to become permanent residents were most likely to move for better housing. The findings also point to structural constraints on residential mobility. For poor migrants without a Jiangsu hukou, moving to better housing was simply not an option. This suggests that further hukou reform is needed if urban redevelopment is not only meant to improve the image of the city but also the migrants’ housing conditions. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",demolition redevelopment; housing conditions; hukou; residential mobility; Rural–urban migrants; Yangzhou,housing conditions; housing policy; redevelopment; residential mobility; rural population; rural-urban migration; urban development; China; Jiangsu; Yangzhou,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076365873,1

It finds that although researchers draw upon multiple strands of evidence and recognize housing as a complex problem, the political framing of a housing crisis is simpler and shows a closer relationship to long standing ideological perspectives, notably an inefficient planning system and low supply of development land.

Yet, there is a little understanding of how such changes have occurred in homeownership attainment in developing countries where there is male dominance. Using Ghana as a case study, this study explores the evolution of women’s role in homeownership. Findings show that although men exercise greater control in terms of investment and ownership, gender contract renegotiations often lead to an increase in women’s participation in homeownership mainly in supportive capacities. Renegotiations have mostly occurred to demystify the normative ideology tying men with the sole responsibility of housing investments. As a consequence, there is evidence of women making financial contributions, supervising construction activities and exploring cost-saving measures to aid the process of family house construction. Generally, findings show that homeownership enhances reproductive roles, uplifts status of men and acknowledges the contributions of women. Similarly, new norms of inheritance supported by statutory and customary law offer ownership stakes to women. In view of this benefit, women tend to be motivated towards providing support for the attainment of family homeownership. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Gender contracts negotiations; Ghana; homeownership; self-building; women,developing world; family structure; gender role; homeownership; womens status; Ghana,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075328923,0

Unlike public or social housing programs, demand-side subsidies require recipients to enter the private market to use their benefits. The focus of this study is the experiences of assisted households in the private housing market and the outcomes they achieve. Given the link between policy design and program outcomes and because all housing subsidy programs are not created equal, one might expect the experiences and outcomes of recipients to also vary. To examine this relationship, using data from national housing surveys, this study analyzes cross-national variation in housing support programs and compares the housing and neighbourhood outcomes of subsidized households in the US, the UK, and the Netherlands. The findings of this study highlight that market context and policy design are associated with housing outcomes. In particular, the strong tenant supports and favourable design of housing assistance in the Netherlands is associated with favourable outcomes for subsidized households. In the US and the UK, subsidized households, in general, underperform their unsubsidized peers.

Our first analysis tracks two parental cohorts, from 1995 and 2005, over 10 years, and shows that non-native parents have become less stable, whereas native parents have the same stability in both periods. A second observation is that native parents, and only this group, are more stable in areas with spacious dwellings. Finally, we also show that parents who leave the inner city, especially non-natives, increase their representation in low-rise houses.

We bring together two historically important theoretical developments to better understand the social and economic distribution of cold housing. Drawing on nationally representative data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey between 2001 and 2016, we find that the characteristics of households unable to adequately heat their homes strongly reflects known patterns of inequality across, for example, tenure, employment and health, but that there are also more unexpected trends in age and income.

However, little empirical evidence exists about the role of regional conditions in making low-income renter households more vulnerable to housing instability. This paper examines the regional determinants of housing instability by analyzing Panel Study of Income Dynamics data uniquely combined with several secondary data sources. This study confirms that a significant regional variation in the likelihood of experiencing housing instability exists across metropolitan areas, even when all measurable household-level characteristics are controlled. The results reveal that low-income renter households are likely to experience housing instability in metropolitan areas where the poverty rate and the degree of automobile dependency are high. Notably, low-income renter households are placed at a heightened risk of housing instability when they have no private vehicle and reside in highly automobile-dependent metropolitan areas. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",automobile dependency; Housing instability; low-income renter households; the Panel Study of Income Dynamics,household income; low income population; metropolitan area; poverty; residential mobility; urban housing; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074585435,1

It finds that while the program as a whole is limited in both participation and benefit provision, the level of HPF activities has differed across localities. Panel-data analysis of HPF lending in seven cities reveals that local housing affordability was an important determinant of who benefited from the program. Rising housing price increased the demand for HPF loans. But if price rose too high relative to household income, the share of participants who used HPF loans declined. This shows that as the program currently operates, expanding HPF participation would only increase the inequality in the distribution of program benefits. Finally, we did not find evidence for the counter-cyclic effects that HPF lending was expected to have in relation to bank lending.

Model outputs are applied to a microsimulation model to estimate the duration of episodes and the cumulative incidence of subsequent episodes of housing and homelessness. The results suggest that private housing markets carry an increased risk of housing exit relative to social housing.

The provision of a transfer or the lack of one largely determines the housing tenure of Czech young adults. Without transfers, the children of homeowners are significantly less likely to also become homeowners. We also show that the probability of an adult child receiving a transfer and the size of the transfer are closely linked (a) to the adult child’s within-family socialisation and (b) to the fact of whether the parents had also received a transfer from their parents in the past and how large that transfer was. These findings have important implications for how housing markets operate and for social inequalities. For example, if an established history of within-family transfers is a predictor of homeownership in future cohorts, this may mean that an important part of society will be systemically and predictably excluded from access to homeownership and a fixed axis of reproduced housing wealth inequality may form. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",homeownership; Housing transfers; post-socialist society,financial system; homeownership; housing conditions; housing management; housing market; housing provision; residential development; Czech Republic,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059001110,0

In the theoretical discussion, the concept of affordances has been seen as promising in grasping the desirable dwelling features and how they become meaningful in everyday uses. However, the concept has been used surprisingly little in empirical housing studies. This article introduces an inventive method to study affordances and contributes to the understanding of the concept by reflecting its usefulness in the context of housing research. The method consists of focus group interviews guided by participant-produced photographs, which allows the participants more freedom to define what they consider meaningful in their dwellings. The results reveal some desirable dwelling features largely uncovered by the public or scholarly discussions yet. From residents’ perspective, developing higher quality housing means paying greater attention to the mundane “secondary spaces”, the sensory experiences and the related atmospheric qualities, as well as the continuums between interior and exterior spaces.

Thus, this article investigates the factors that have caused obstacles to the coordination of housing policies in metropolitan areas of Latin American countries, based on a case study of the policies promoted by the national governments of Brazil and Mexico. The results highlight the need to reflect on the process of the financialization of housing at the national and sub-national levels, which represents a major obstacle to integrated, metropolitan housing management. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Brazil; Financialization; housing policy; Latin America; metropolitan areas; Mexico,financial system; housing market; housing policy; local government; metropolitan area; socioeconomic status; urban housing; Brazil; Latin America; Mexico [North America],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074867267,0

Drawing on research in three diverse cities, we stage an unlikely dialogue that brings together narratives of housing across the global North–South divide. In doing so, we are concerned with thinking housing relationally in two broad senses: first, housing as a relational composite of economy, space, politics, legality and materials, structured by particular relations of power and resource inequality. Second, housing as a space of learning through comparison, which connects geographically and culturally in distinct cities. What do we learn about relational thinking with regards to housing when we compare it across the global North–South divide? In response, we explore a dialogue between a set of cities often off-the-map in debates on housing and urban research: Gateshead (UK), Kampala (Uganda) and Tirana (Albania). In comparing how housing is produced, distributed and inhabited, we seek to contribute to a wider understanding of the relationalities of housing. © 2020 The Author(s).

The concept of ‘unbounding’ is used to trace the fluidity and connections established between migrant homes and neighbourhood socio-ecologies. Walking interviews exploring women’s livelihoods reveal that different expendable agencies of the urban environment (e.g. trash, weeds and animal excreta) create conditions for labour in which migrant women hold specific competencies to secure essential resources for home. Unbounding positions home within a socio-ecology of multiple houses that women traverse to support their urban living. The approach offers opportunities to examine the unique ways urban homeless populations strategically as well as affectively engage with under-recognized agencies and actors in informal settlements.

We adopt an assemblage methodology to examine this case of privileged tenant activism and find that it provides an additive lens for understanding the networks of relations that influenced the community during the mid-2000s.

Amidst a rising tide of anti-homeless sentiment, city officials and police department administrators switched from calling such dwellings ‘encampments’ to ‘homeless hotspots’, which were defined as anywhere with two or more homeless people in public space. Using data from city policy memos, interviews with homeless people, ethnographic fieldwork with a homeless-led organization, and data from the city’s 311 user-driven complaint system, this article argues that in practice, the shift to hotspots demonstrates the relational geography of homelessness. Selective enforcement of the visible ‘homeless hotspot’ took place in recently-gentrified neighbourhoods, suggesting that the idea of a homeless hotspot itself and the financialized home are co-produced and co-dependent, created through one another. This relational geography, in turn, sheds light on the pervasiveness of anti-homelessness, force that changes with political winds but retains its power in producing borders and boundaries of urban space. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",gentrification; Homelessness; policing; relational geographies; visibility,gentrification; homelessness; housing policy; language; law enforcement; policy analysis; policy approach; public space; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075572718,0

In addition, using the example of planning practice in England, it examines the ways in which potentially transgressive adaptations of ‘locked-in’ calculative practices are resisted.

For those at the bottom end of the sector, who typically have limited economic resources, it is a precarious housing tenure due to its expense and insecurity, yet few studies have explored qualitatively the emotional consequences of this for well-being. We address this gap in the ‘generation rent’ literature by focusing attention on those voices that have been less prominent in the literature. Informed by the theoretical lens of ‘residential alienation’, our study illustrates the emotional toll of private renting upon low-income groups in a national context where state regulation is more limited. In doing so, we add nuance to the literature surrounding socio-economic differentiation within the UK private-rented sector.

Drawing on interviews with 13 older tenants, we observe the uneasy relationship between tenure insecurity and housing quality, and tensions between choice and luck in experiences of renting in later life. Three pathways related to renting in older age were apparent: life-long renting; loss of homeownership through adversity; and deliberate decisions to transition to renting. We note that challenges encountered in current and previous housing situations lead to diverse narratives of precarity in later life.

By adapting the established concept of labour market dualization to housing, this paper examines how employment and housing positions are intertwined under late capitalism, and how their relationship has changed through the Global Financial Crisis. Examining the salient case of the Netherlands through household-level data from the LISS panel, we demonstrate that being a labour market ‘outsider’ vastly increases the likelihood of being an ‘outsider’ across housing market dimensions, in terms of housing equity, affordability and prospective asset accumulation.

While the quantity of public housing units is increasing, residents’ attachment to the community remains underexplored. This study evaluates the social dimension of public housing from the perspective of community attachment in Guangzhou, China. We use a mixed methods approach to examine what factors influence community attachment in both public and commodity housing communities. We first analyse quantitative data (N = 344) collected from four public housing and commodity housing communities in Guangzhou using confirmatory factor analysis, hierarchical regression, and moderation analysis. Results show that housing type has no significant effect on community attachment. Housing type moderates the relationship between community ties, perceived public services, and community attachment, whereas community ties and perceived public services are positively associated with community attachment only for commodity housing residents. Qualitative data from 21 semi-structured interviews are then used to explain the quantitative results. Our findings support the rationality of the public housing strategy in China from the perspective of community attachment. We also argue that community attachment must be analysed in a contextualized approach. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",China; community attachment; Community sentiment; moderation analysis; public housing,factor analysis; hierarchical system; housing reform; public service; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; regression analysis; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073813926,1

Results confirm that, all else constant, employed immigrants who have naturalized are 26% more likely to be homeowner. Additional analyses specifically designed to isolate endogeneity bias show that the effect is smaller, but still reveal an increase in the probability of homeownership after naturalization. Citizenship acquisition matters less for migrants with a native-born partner, suggesting that legal status discrimination may be an underlying mechanism. I find no evidence that the relevance of citizenship is conditioned by cultural distance of the origin country or the post-2008 economic crisis.

This paper uses recent data and multivariate analysis to explore the impact of neighborhood racial composition and poverty rate on LIHTC development in the Boston metropolitan region.

Drawing on in-depth interviews with housing associations and stakeholders, the article highlights the increasing use of affordability assessments for prospective tenants. These assessments interact with mid-market rental products to increase the potential for exclusion from affordable housing on the grounds of ability to pay. This conditionality is applied not only at the point of tenancy access, but also at renewal of fixed-term tenancies. The research highlights that the combination of welfare and housing policies, in the context of a financialising housing association sector, has the potential to erode access to social housing for those who are perceived as a financial risk, reshaping the focus of social housing. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Alongside this, hybrid organisations have emerged in the Private Rented Sector (PRS), responding to sectoral growth and consequent increases in vulnerable households entering private renting. These developing hybridities have been considered at a strategic level, but there has been little exploration of the impacts on tenants.

The research suggests that different forms of hybridity can affect tenant outcomes and, moreover, that examining such impacts is important in understanding hybridity itself. Furthermore, the study suggests that emerging forms of hybridity, particularly in the PRS, may be blurring the boundaries between housing sectors, with implications for policy and research. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Despite growing attention to housing inequality in China, little research has been undertaken to reveal the extent to which a family of origin contributes to housing inequality among young adults. Family resources could support the young generation to achieve homeownership not only directly through intergenerational transfers of wealth, but also indirectly through intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic characteristics. Using the 2013 Fudan Yangtze River Delta Social Transformation Survey, this study constructs a structural equation model to examine the direct and indirect influence of parents’ resources on the young generation’s housing outcomes. The results show that the direct influence of parents’ homeownership is prominent, whereas the impact of transmitted socioeconomic status is limited. Housing advantages of parents, derived from their superior institutional status during China’s housing reforms, are being transmitted to their offspring, particularly to sons. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",China; homeownership; Intergenerational transmission; reproduction of inequality; young generation,affordable housing; homeownership; housing market; intergenerational transfer; numerical model; socioeconomic status; urban housing; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070444055,1

This study expands upon the limited literature to examine house price diffusion of housing submarkets (namely, low-priced and high-priced submarkets) in Greater Sydney, one of the most diverse housing markets in Australia, using convergence tests, cointegration techniques, Granger causality and dynamic ordinary least square cointegration tests. The results show that a long-run relationship in house prices exists between these two submarkets in Greater Sydney. Importantly, the empirical results show that a large degree of diffusion takes place from the less prosperous submarket to the high-end submarket. This supports the equity transfer hypothesis via a filtering process in which house prices in the low-priced submarket will be transmitted into the high-priced submarket. The study also finds that the low-priced submarket is the primary reactor to changes in economic fundamentals.

These entry points relate to relatively understudied structural transformations of our urban housing systems implicated in the rise of BtR, namely: (1) the diversification of build-to-sell development models; (2) the evolution of the private rental sector; and (3) labour market–housing market realignments. Comparative inquiry promises to enrich understandings of BtR by revealing how city rental accommodation and tenancies are recalibrated by the investment imperatives of institutional investors and BtR asset shareholders, and with what benefits and at what costs to whom. Such contributions will also provide rich data to progress conceptual efforts to locate BtR within broader processes of housing financialization. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Build-to-Rent; Financialization of rental housing; institutional investors; multifamily rental housing; private rental sector,conceptual framework; empirical analysis; finance; future prospect; housing market; labor market; rental sector; theoretical study; urban housing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084341210,1

It focuses on employees and assesses the a priori ambiguous effect of homeownership on job-match quality. We use the French data set of the 1995–2001 European Community Household Panel to build a subjective measure of job downgrading. We estimate a recursive trivariate probit with partial observability that simultaneously models the residential status choice, its impact on the probability of being downgraded, and the selection into employment. Taking into account, the double selection process, into employment and into homeownership, and controlling unobserved individual heterogeneity, we find that private renters have between 30% and 40% higher probability of subjective downgrading than homeowners. Mortgage constraints increase the downgrading probability, but their effect is of a limited scope (around +2% percentage points for mortgagers compared with outright owners). We show that these results are robust to various specifications and instruments choice. Consequently, homeownership seems not to be associated to some harmful effects on the job-match quality.

Drawing on research carried out in an Australian jurisdiction, we show how policies regarding the supply and allocation of social housing compel homelessness service providers—including Housing First services—to employ conditionality practices. We also demonstrate the detrimental impact this has on the housing outcomes of homelessness people with complex needs.

Regressions on building, location, and neighborhood characteristics reveal factors associated with higher serial and nonserial filing rates and serial share. We find that the largest owners and larger buildings tend to have high serial shares. When looking at nonserial filings, which are more likely to result in tenant displacement, neighborhood race is a strong independent predictor; properties in Black neighborhoods have substantially higher nonserial filing rates, other things equal. Another key result is that sales in the prior three years have a significant, nontrivial positive effect on the nonserial filing rate, so that property turnover is a significant predictor of rising evictions.

The article argues that theories of financialization provide a useful framework for understanding ‘generation rent’. In particular, the cyclical nature of credit markets tends to undermine homeownership over the medium term. This contributes to and intensifies the wider set of policy changes associated with neoliberalism. The article also accounts for the divergent experiences of our three case study countries within their common trajectory. It does so through an analytical focus on the interaction between global aspects of financialization and more nationally based ones, such as mortgage markets, as well as on how both are mediated by national policy regimes. The article thus aims to contribute to the emerging literature seeking to explain ‘generation rent’ and explore its significance, and more broadly to political economy approaches to housing system change. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",financialization; Generation rent; global financial crisis; homeownership; housing system change; private rental sector,comparative study; financial crisis; financial provision; homeownership; housing finance; housing market; rental sector; residential development; Ireland; Spain; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068217563,0

Having been homeless or sleeping rough in the previous year is associated with approximately four times mean health and justice costs compared with not having experienced homelessness.

A qualitative content analysis of blogs featured on two national websites advertising rental properties in Australia, identifies six aspects of interactions between the tenant and property manager argued to impact a tenant’s ability to secure a rental property: responsibility, making an impression, established relationships, honesty, flexibility and creative thinking.

It begins by distinguishing different interpretative variants of neoliberalism and some of the criticisms regarding its explanatory capability. Taking the example of housing associations in England, the paper makes use of Dardot and Laval’s notion of ‘entrepreneurial governmentality’ to interpret how contemporary welfare professionals attempt to reconcile the competing tensions of individualism and egalitarianism in practice. Amongst the arguments put forward is that the extension of commercialism, commodification and competition have generated new fissures and dissonance within the sector. The conclusion suggests that contemporary variants of neoliberalism are best understood as a rationality that establishes entrepreneurial governmentality across sectors of government, the economy and social life. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",England; entrepreneurialism; housing associations; Neoliberalism,entrepreneur; housing association; housing conditions; housing policy; neoliberalism; residential development; socioeconomic status; England; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066834641,0

The findings reveal that, although single women are less likely than single men to become homeowners, women are more likely to make the transition if they live with a partner.

Mobilizing a pathways approach, this paper examines homeless young people’s experiences of seeking housing in a context of housing market forces that blocked their efforts to carve a route out of homelessness. The research, which is biographical and longitudinal, was conducted in Ireland between 2013 and 2016 and involved the collection of data at two points in time. At baseline, 40 young people aged 16–24 years and 10 of their family members were recruited (Phase 1) and, at the point of follow-up two years later (Phase 2), 74% of participants were retained in the study. By Phase 2, just 24% of the study’s young people were housed, pointing to significant barriers of access to housing. Moving beyond the identification of the impact of housing market forces on young people’s ability to exit homelessness, the analysis examines young people’s responses, focussing on the strategies used by them as they attempted to reclaim autonomy and control over their housing futures.

New infrastructural analyses attend to how infrastructures pattern social life and identify the values that are selectively coded into infrastructures, (re)producing social difference through use. We argue that housing patterns care across three domains: through housing materialities, markets and governance. First, we identify how housing patterns the organization of care at a household and social scale. Second, we attend to the relational politics of care through housing, asking how care is ordered through housing and to whose benefit. Third, we consider where and how care is located in housing.

This paper critically explores the relative influence of ‘Generation X’ in shaping social capital accumulation and distribution strategies within English MGHs. We contend that this cohort, described here as ‘amalgamation generation’, (older ‘boomerangers’) recognize how the quintessential inter/intra generational forms of social capital present in MGHs may be consolidated to boost resilience at a time of economic uncertainty and social instability. We challenge therefore the largely negative discourse surrounding boomerangers which exist in existing scholarship. Our analysis highlights the dialectical relationship between the concepts of resilience and social capital when applied to multigenerational living. In doing so, we highlight the relevance of network centrality, shared family values, an awareness of the natural life cycle and the importance of family ‘social capital bank’ in promoting the overall cohesion of the MGH. The extent to which English MGHs may be construed as a liquid, temporal and fluid asset over space, place and time is explored. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",boomerangers; family; housing; Multigenerational; resilience; social capital,banking; family structure; housing; social capital,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065534741,0

This focus fosters a number of problems, including inflated housing values, increased segregation, economic divisions, and the foreclosure crisis. Community land trusts (CLTs) put land in a non-profit trust to keep it affordable long-term. We examine CLTs as affordable housing organizations where individual residents own homes in the trust and lease the land underneath from the CLT. Interviews of CLT homeowners and staff in Minnesota, USA, show that the use value of CLT housing creates opportunities for different life choices. CLT homeowners cite stability and autonomy as the primary benefits of homeownership. They expressed newfound confidence and freedom to pursue personal goals and live less restricted lives after moving into CLT homes, a finding also emphasized by CLT staff. Limited equity housing such as CLTs can both reinforce dominant meanings of homeownership as providing security and autonomy, while also fostering access and affordability for low-income residents. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",community land trust; Homeownership; housing affordability; housing investment; Minnesota; USA; use value,affordable housing; equity; homeownership; housing finance; housing market; investment; land use planning; Minnesota; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065504271,0

Yet, few scholars have studied country-wide changes in tenure mix, due to the lack of data and appropriate methods. In this article, we propose to use tenure type landscapes to analyse changes in housing policy. We do so while acknowledging the evolution of housing policies in Sweden since 1990. Using individualized and multi-scalar tenure type landscapes to measure change in neighbourhoods, we analyse housing clusters in 1990 and 2012. We show that the tenure landscape in 1990 at the height of the welfare state was fairly diverse and mixed. During the next 22 years, however, the landscape changed to become more homogenized and dominated by ownership through tenure conversions and new housing. We argue that awareness of these changes is essential to understanding present and future segregation and gentrification processes. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

This study was conducted in Nunavut and Nunavik, two of the four Inuit regions in Canada, where the prevalence of overcrowding is six times the national average. Sense of home was derived from the conceptual notion of ontological security, where home is defined as a symbolic place for making claims of cultural identity and belonging. Sense of home was operationalized according to participants’ perception of their home in relation to space, identity, control, privacy, satisfaction, relationships, location, and security. Overcrowding was negatively associated with sense of home. In overcrowded dwellings, fewer women reported positive perceptions of their house with regards to sufficient space, feeling of identity, satisfaction and domestic relationships. Relational and cultural aspects of housing resonate with sense of home and may be particularly interesting to examine as potential mechanisms leading to individual and community wellbeing. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",gender; housing needs; Indigenous Peoples; Inuit; overcrowding; sense of home,cultural identity; gender; indigenous population; overcrowding; perception; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Nunavik; Nunavut; Quebec [Canada],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068928331,0

The article illustrates this approach in an analysis of the use of direct democracy to decide housing allocations in the policy of neighbourhood planning in England. Drawing on literature from Science and Technology Studies and actor–network theory, it evidences the public articulation of house-building as a matter of concern and identifies the agency of housing in enrolling publics, translating interests and in fostering debate and contention.

The Fundo de Garantia do Tempo de Serviço (FGTS) is a compulsory savings scheme, managed by the state and financed through monthly deposits made by employers on behalf of their employees. The FGTS resembles a personalized public pension, but the balance of an individual FGTS account can also be used to facilitate access to homeownership. We do not argue that this is an inclusionary and redistributive policy, but we do argue that the FGTS acts as a facilitator of asset-building for those included in the formal labour market.

Collaborative, self-organized multi-residential housing in Australia is known as ‘deliberative’ development to differentiate it from ‘speculative’ development. We draw on case studies of deliberative development in Australia to reveal how projects are financed and how financing impacts on social equity considerations. Proponents of contemporary deliberative development in Australia are deeply concerned about housing affordability and declining rates of home ownership. This has focused attention on development financing as a key to systemic change paving the way for inclusion of less wealthy households. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Australia; Baugruppen; deliberative development; development finance; home ownership; housing affordability; multi-residential housing,affordable housing; homeownership; housing finance; residential development; social inclusion; social movement; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065436886,0

The latter are also good indicator of regulatory policy and local government behaviour. The heuristic hypothesis put forward in this article is that, because of concomitant favourable market conditions and the devolution process that began in the 1990s, the introduction of the property tax (ICI) induced municipalities to adopt less tight urban policies to offset budgetary needs and compensate for the reduction in central government transfers. To this end, it estimates an econometric model to verify the impact of the main economic variables on new housing supply. Unlike other studies, this article run an analysis at regional level and test for fixed effects and structural break. Our estimates support our hypothesis, evidencing a time effect. They also confirm that introduction of the ICI tax did not affect the construction sector. Careful attention, therefore, should be given to the issue of whether leaving urban planning and the power to levy property taxes under the same jurisdiction. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",building permits; land use; property tax; Urban development,housing market; numerical model; property market; regional development; regression analysis; urban development; urban housing; Italy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065307812,1

Yet, there remains uncertainty around the drivers of these preferences. In Auckland, the development of a spatial plan emphasizing intensification has attracted opposition from residents, reinforcing a notion that compact housing is largely unappealing. Utilizing a housing pathways approach, we question this notion through examining the housing narratives of Generation Y, a cohort whose preferences are largely ignored in this debate and poorly understood within housing research. This paper highlights the influence of past experiences on attitudes to changing urban environments, providing several themes related to housing experiences that have the potential to influence preferences. We conclude that a process of ‘acclimatisation’ to density is likely as Generation Y become exposed to higher-density housing. However, to encourage positive experiences, compact dwellings must attend to the dynamic nature of contemporary housing pathways and provide quality housing, located where young people aspire to live. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",home ownership; housing choice; Housing pathways; residential mobility; urban intensification; young adults,adult; homeownership; housing management; residential development; residential mobility; urbanization; Auckland [North Island]; New Zealand; North Island,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063988634,0

This review revealed that common target populations were low income households, children and the elderly. The review found that people’s expectations and culturally constructed heating practices influenced indoor temperatures and householder satisfaction. Very deprived households were still affected by financial constraints despite the intervention measures. Excessive ventilation and limited technical mastery counteracted the beneficial effects of the intervention measures.

The study presented in this paper focuses on intra-metropolitan variation in household formation among young adults and attempts to explain it from a macro perspective, emphasizing the importance of a community’s ‘primary’ or purpose-built rental sector. Following a review of the international literature on the impacts of housing supply and availability on household formation, panel regression models are estimated to examine the effects of changes in the relative supply and real cost of purpose-built rental housing on changes in young people’s household formation in Canadian metropolitan areas between 1991 and 2016. The results indicate that a 1% increase in the relative supply of purpose-built rental housing leads to 0.24% and 0.14% increases in the rates of family and non-family household formation of young adults.

Based on the China Labour-force Dynamics Survey (CLDS), this study decomposes homeowners’ housing differentiation along three dimensions: housing conditions, housing wealth, and neighbourhood environment. We also examine the impacts of these dimensions on homeowners’ subjective social status (SSS).

Even though housing policy and public housing provision falls under provincial government jurisdiction, the crisis response was largely mobilized by local stakeholders. Drawing upon a five year tracking study, this paper traces the rise of new governance arrangements to address local housing pressures. These governance arrangements fostered greater community awareness of housing issues; strengthened relationships across community, industry, and some senior government stakeholders; and renewed local housing assets. This collective capacity to manage housing pressures, however, remains vulnerable due to public policy incoherence that undermines or fails to adequately support local governance initiatives. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",construction; governance; housing; policy; Rural,governance approach; housing policy; housing provision; industrial development; investment; local government; stakeholder; British Columbia; Canada; Kitimat,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087822304,0

Spotlighting this previously hidden but significant Chinese housing submarket, the episode highlighted ‘homeowner’ concerns over insecure property rights. Internationally, commercial-to-residential conversion is nothing new. Indeed, it has been championed as a contributor to addressing housing shortage. How has an internationally well-established practice generated such tensions in China? Focusing on the Shanghai case, this paper analyzes the processes involved in commercial-to-residential apartment conversion by examining interactions between state, market players and ‘homebuyers’, drawing on discourse and policy analysis. Reflecting consideration for short-term gains and conflict avoidance, state regulations were historically vague and open to interpretation. Non-government stakeholder behaviour was underpinned by hopes that legitimacy of residential use would be subsequently confirmed. The 2017 ‘policy clarification’ has placed CPCA owners at risk of major financial losses and possibly even homelessness.

In particular, I examine the case of the Platform for People Affected by Mortgages (PAH), the main organization in the Spanish housing movement between 2009 and 2017. First, I discuss how their demands were framed according to specific contexts of legitimation. Second, I distinguish the nature and scope of the outcomes produced by this movement. My analysis uniquely combines a critical assessment of the PAH’s achievements with its unintended consequences and the significant social, political and economic contexts that help to explain its major outcomes. The global financial crisis, the convergence of the PAH with other anti-neoliberal movements and shifts among the dominant political parties determine the opportunities and constraints of the PAH’s development. Within this environment, the housing movement strategically operates by framing the culprits of the economic crisis in a new manner and by appealing to a broad social base beyond the impoverished mortgage holders. I also include the capacity of the movement’s organization to last, expand and increase its legitimacy as a relevant socio-political outcome.

Such investigation is important, since the benefits of investment in an owner-occupied residence expand beyond individual wealth accumulation. Homeowners have a greater incentive to invest in their neighbourhoods and are more engaged with their local communities. These individual incentives engender social benefits. Using the Canadian National Household Survey of 2011, this paper examines how religious identity associates with the patterns of real estate wealth accumulation in Canada. Three interrelated outcomes of homeownership, value of the dwelling and the likelihood of carrying a mortgage are considered. The differences among a number of religious groups are non-negligible and impervious to the inclusion of controls. In accord with the US patterns, conservative Protestants are found at a disadvantage in real estate wealth accumulation. Jews, the highest earning group, are found to have a lower likelihood of homeownership, compared with most other groups. But, conditional on owning, Jews have more valuable homes. Muslims, the lowest earning group, are found the least likely to own. But, conditional on homeownership, Muslims are less likely than all other groups to carry a mortgage. Sikhs are found to statistically significantly differ from Hindus, in their homeownership rates and the value of their dwellings.

Two waves from the Neighbourhood Profile survey (N = 8507) were used, which included measures of the contact frequency with neighbours and their willingness to help. We find that for the less-well educated neighbourhood ties have a modest negative relation to employment. Moreover, this relation does not vary across neighbourhoods with different socioeconomic statuses, with the exception of part-time working men. Our research implies that neighbourhood ties in mixed neighbourhoods do not positively relate to employment for the less-well educated, thereby questioning policy assumptions about ‘social mix’.

This is principally due to The Homelessness Etc.

This has been widely praised for extending citizenship rights to those experiencing homelessness. In contrast to this, this paper examines the experiences of young people (aged 16–24) where judgements on whether they were ‘housing ready’ delayed them being provided settled accommodation. Drawing on Bourdieu's writing on rites of institution, it is shown how the symbolic categories deployed by support services and landlords operated as a means of ‘vision and division’, creating new social positions that lengthened the pathway out of homelessness.

As resilience will increasingly drive global investments over the next century the aim of the article is to move away from rigid and conservative expressions of resilience to a more evolutionary approach relevant to regional housing systems. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",adaptive capacity; Epistemic community; evolutionary resilience; redundancy; regional housing; slow-burn shock,housing conditions; housing management; housing project; investment; literature review; planning process; regional planning,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055543738,0

Drawing on in-depth interviews with public housing tenants and homeowners, media reports and government media releases, it argues that a key reason for the displacement was the super-gentrification of the area that was hastened dramatically by the Barangaroo development, a massive urban spectacle on the site of the old port adjacent to Millers Point. Unlike the earlier analyses of super-gentrification described by Lees and Butler where an already gentrified area is settled by super wealthy households over a period of time, the shift to super-gentrification status in Millers Point did not involve households moving into an area already gentrified. Rather, the process was premised on the Barangaroo development and the displacement of public housing tenants. The displacement meant that the heritage-listed public housing dwelling were now available for purchase by exceptionally wealthy households. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Australia; Displacement; public housing; super-gentrification; Sydney,forced migration; gentrification; homeowner; household income; housing provision; inner city area; urban housing; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053673268,0

This article examines how the distribution of homeownership in Sweden relates to two factors widely seen as significant to such inequalities, namely parental tenure status and place of birth. We use longitudinal registry data to examine the bearing of these two factors on individual-level tenure progression since the beginning of the 1990s for persons at different stages of their housing careers. We extend existing understandings of Swedish homeownership patterns by demonstrating that inequalities relating to place of birth and parental tenure intersect with one another in ways that substantially advantage certain subgroups while disadvantaging others, and by demonstrating that experiences of entry into homeownership have in recent years been changing in markedly different ways for these different subgroups. Overall, Swedish homeownership inequalities, far from dissipating, appear to be hardening along existing lines. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The results show that in Britain, first-time homeownership transitions are tightly synchronized with partnership formation. By contrast, in Germany first moves into homeownership typically occur later around or after the arrival of children. Parental owner-occupation accelerates entry into homeownership in both contexts, while the effects of other parental characteristics are relatively muted. Furthermore, the results highlight how individual socioeconomic factors are critical determinants of entering owner-occupation.

It investigates lived experiences through in-depth interviews with homeowners in the context of the pre-demolition phase, i.e. an inevitable prospect of having to move out. The article reveals how these homeowners cleverly mobilize local resources, such as strong social bonds, low living costs, flexibility on space use and good neighbourhood location to cope with their life constraints, which is translated into their strong neighbourhood attachment. However, various forms of neighbourhood decline have decreased their quality of life. Meanwhile, they soon have to move due to the impending demolition of their neighbourhood. State-led urban redevelopment, therefore, confronts those deprived residents with a dilemma concerning their strong neighbourhood dependence and their desire for better living conditions. The impending neighbourhood demolition uncovers accumulated social issues in danwei communities in the context of market reforms and institutional changes in current China, such as the emergence of deprived social groups and their struggles for better housing. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The results confirm that the concept of residential disadvantage is also relevant in rural areas, and that in the Czech Republic residence in remote rural areas with limited educational levels and a high concentration of low-pay jobs has negative yet weak contextual effects, whereas increased levels of deprivation and social exclusion, typical also of many urban regions, are not decisive.

We look at how homophily affects the spatial relocation patterns of homeowners in Glasgow from Scottish, Indian, Pakistani and Chinese descent, and focus on the extent to which homophily extends beyond the immediate locality to surrounding neighbourhoods. Our interest is in estimating the “homophily horizon”–how far the gaze of homophily reaches in mover location decisions. Using a simple Schelling-type theoretical model, we argue that homophily horizons are potentially important in shaping the long-term social structure of cities as they may profoundly affect how potent the overall sorting tendencies of the housing market are in driving segregation. In principle, the more distant the homophily horizon, the more quickly the housing market will tend towards segregation, other things being equal. We adopt Folch and Rey’s use of the local centralization index to capture the influence of surrounding neighbourhoods in shaping mover flows and neighbourhood dynamics. Our estimation combines ethnic mover flows derived from surname analysis of house buyers from the house transactions recorded in Registers of Scotland data. Our results show that the presence of the own ethnic group in the local surroundings is important for explaining mover flows, and that homophily is a local phenomenon. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This study draws on semi-structured in-depth interviews with forced migrants who arrived in Austria in recent years. The analysis of newcomers’ housing entry pathways not only sheds light on the coordination structures at work in a city of social housing, but also on ‘good’ and ‘bad’ rental housing submarkets that have emerged in the course of the recent refugee movement.

In New Zealand the hegemony of high quality service has resisted other mediation forms; retaining socially negotiated housing outcomes.

Thus, many householders and their families faced the prospect of losing their homes. This paper employs a unique data-set linking the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation with individual foreclosure event records from Realty Trac to examine the effects of foreclosure on changes in household well-being. Results from random effects models suggest that foreclosure was positively associated with hardship and food insecurity. Further, households at risk of foreclosure had greater odds of accessing government assistance programs but lower odds of receiving support from private safety nets. Results from lagged dependent variable models suggest that changes in foreclosure status are associated with increased hardship and reduced economic well-being. The lack of access to private safety nets suggests the need for comprehensive public programs to identify and assist homeowners at risk. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",family well-being; Foreclosure; material hardship; safety nets; social support,data set; family structure; homeowner; household income; housing conditions; housing market; safety,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049585034,1

This context raises an important question of how likely the state’s reliance on the private sector can ensure that housing remains available and accessible to more disadvantaged low-income groups. To help answer this question, we draw on a comparative study of social housing provision for disabled people in England and Chile; two pioneers of neoliberal reform in this sector. Using interviews with key stakeholders, our findings reveal that the neoliberal reform strategies being employed have tended to dilute the statutory duties of providing accessible housing and to undermine disabled people’s choices in finding appropriate homes.

And yet in recent years, large ‘property developer housing associations’ have begun to invest in for-profit private rental homes let at market rents. Despite long waiting lists for their accommodation, these housing associations are mainly letting their for-profit rental homes to middle-income tenants rather than their traditional low-income clientele. Drawing on a ‘historical institutional’ conceptual framework, and combining structural and ‘agency’ explanations, this paper explores the reasons for this new trend. It argues that investment by large developer housing associations in for-profit and more upmarket rental homes will become increasingly important relative to their non-profit social housing. Over time, this ‘partial recalibration’ of their landlord role is likely to gradually transform the institutional rules, everyday practices and norms that shape their behaviour. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",build to rent; historical institutionalism; Housing associations; private rental housing,housing market; institutional framework; investment; profitability; rental sector; social housing; England; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048738553,1

Relocation altered two key contexts directly, home and neighbourhood, and may have indirectly altered the other contexts–peers, school and family. However, we found there were as many non-relocation related factors as relocation factors associated with outcomes, and a number of significant critical moments affecting CYP’s lives. Whilst relocation can seem the ‘big thing’ from the point of view of practitioners and researchers, from the perspective of CYP, it can seem a small part of the much bigger picture of change in their lives. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Neighbourhoods; relocation; social housing; young people,child welfare; neighborhood; qualitative analysis; relocation; social housing; young population,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047801855,1

Using National French Housing Survey data, an original application with a probit model with a double sample selection (being a tenant, and being eligible for means-tested allowances) follows. Estimation results show that housing allowances help to cope with some life events but that otherwise their recipients remain more exposed to housing financial hardship than their counterparts do. The gap between recipients and non-recipients is larger for the households with children than for those without despite the goal of horizontal equity. A nonlinear decomposition shows that the difference in probability between recipients and non-recipients is mostly explained by the endowment of characteristics in 2001 and by the return to risk in 2013. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",financial difficulties; housing affordability; Housing allowances; selection effect; unpaid rent,affordable housing; financial crisis; financial provision; household structure; literature review; rental sector,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047786548,1

The results suggest that mobility intentions do have a significant effect on public housing exits. However, the rate of exit among those who intend to move out of public housing was similar to those who did not intend to leave. In addition, tenure had a significant effect on the odds of exiting alluding to issues of duration dependence. However, neighbourhood conditions did not fully explain public housing exits. Our proxy for policy reform had a large effect on the odds of exiting of public housing. This result suggests that changes in housing assistance programmes and urban housing policy could largely account for public housing exits. Overall, the results imply that while public housing residents may have positive and negative mobility intentions, their exits may primarily be due to shifts in housing policy and social welfare programmes versus individual characteristics and neighbourhood conditions. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",mobility; neighbourhoods; poverty; Public housing; welfare,housing policy; mobility; neighborhood; poverty; social housing; tenure relations; welfare provision,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047429801,1

In the Turkish context, the ‘new social’ is situated at the intersection of spatial transformations, housing representations, neoliberalism and Islam. In the housing estate of the case study, the abstract space was challenged by the bottom-up responses of some residents who tried to create their social space rooted in their previous experiences in the gecekondu; it was reacted by other residents who embraced the higher status of apartment living.

This study also uniquely takes into account individual housing histories in relation to later life fertility outcomes. The data used are an extract from Swedish registers covering 25% of the population. Housing information is available from 1986 to 2006, and the study follows four birth cohorts of women who are aged 15–18 when the study starts, until ages 35–38. Descriptive results on housing and childbearing transitions over the life course are complemented by event-history models to model the parity transitions. Women living in detached housing have the highest likelihood of parity transitions, while women living in rental apartments have the lowest likelihood.

Thus, the Chinese housing system exhibits a transitional nature as the country moves away from a socialist housing system towards a privatized housing system. Using the 2011 Chinese Household Finance Survey, we not only examine these changes in private ownership of housing, but also give an updated evaluation of the privatization process with new empirical evidence. We develop a conceptual framework and an empirical analysis to shed light on distinct housing inequality patterns in transitional urban China. Our results show that both socioeconomic characteristics and socialist institutions contribute to housing inequality, but they follow different paths in the reform and have different impacts on housing inequality. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",housing inequality; Housing ownership; housing wealth; transition,conceptual framework; empirical analysis; homeownership; household income; privatization; socioeconomic status; urban housing; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046038541,1

The findings show a disparity between a high rate of arrears on housing credit, and a low level of eviction and repossession. We test several explanations for this disparity, and argue that it is the result of policy aiming to minimize eviction and repossessions.

A Mediterranean housing system perspective is used to analyse the paradox, and methodological issues regarding the definition and measurement of vacancy are addressed.

Also, a wider definition of housing should be adopted to facilitate improvements in livability. As well, an integrated approach of residential planning is important in intensified housing development projects or planning for dense areas, encompassing housing standards, community facilities, public transport, open space provision and socio-cultural habits.

Conventional models and concepts are not always appropriate and data issues make long-run neighbourhood analysis particularly problematic. This paper addresses some of these points. First, it discusses why the analysis of long-run urban change is important for modern urban policy and considers the most important concepts. Second, it constructs a novel data set at the micro level, which allows consistent comparisons of London neighbourhoods in 1881 and 2001. Third, the paper models some of the key factors that affected long-run change, including the role of housing. There is evidence that the relative social positions of local urban areas persist over time but, nevertheless, at fine spatial scales, local areas still exhibit change, arising from aggregate population dynamics, from advances in technology, and also from the effects of shocks, such as wars. In general, where small areas are considered, long-run changes are likely to be greater, because individuals are more mobile over short than long distances. Finally, the paper considers the implications for policy. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",institutions; local dynamics; Persistence; social status,data set; housing market; long-term change; neighborhood; persistence; social status; urban housing; urban policy; England; London [England]; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049783169,1

Notably, approaches attempting to account for divergent housing tenure patterns and trends have frequently been organized around typologies based on the assumption that a causal relationship exists between homeownership rates and the type of welfare regime or, more recently, the variety of residential capitalism a country exhibits. While these housing-welfare regime approaches have provided important research tools, we argue that the typologies they generate represent cross-sectional snapshots which offer little enduring cogency. Based on long-run data, we show that the postulated associations between homeownership, welfare and mortgage debt are historically contingent. This paper makes the case for employing historicized typologies, proposing a country-based typology linking historical housing finance system trajectories to urban form and tenure, with regional dimensions.

A key move under the Coalition’s welfare reform agenda was the implementation of the underoccupancy penalty—the so-called ‘bedroom tax’—from April 2013. However, while this policy triggered high-profile protests, it does not represent a novel policy preoccupation. Variations on the theme have recurred in housing policy debates almost since the advent of council housing. This paper adopts a long-term perspective and presents a sociological institutionalist analysis which focuses on the mechanisms through which underoccupation has been governed. Drawing on a range of archival material, we argue that the government of underoccupation has undergone revealing transformations over the period since 1929. Not only does the broader policy context—understandings of the purpose of social housing and the role it fulfils in the housing market—differ over time, but, at the more detailed level of policy instruments, the mechanisms proposed to address underoccupation differ in ways that can be explained in terms of prevailing policy logics and institutional structures. Most significantly, the nature of the underoccupation problem has been framed differently: the rationales offered as justification for policy action draw on very different vocabularies, in ways that allow us to trace the influence of more fundamental shifts in policy discourse into the domain of housing policy. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",bedroom tax; governance; institutionalism; policy instruments; Underoccupation,governance approach; housing market; housing policy; institutional framework; policy analysis; rental sector; social housing; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049558676,0

Specifically, this article revisits, 35 years on and against the onset of financialized capitalism, Jim Kemeny’s seminal thesis on the relationship between homeownership and welfare. Focusing on Australia, as a less considered case in the liberal Anglophone cluster, it traces how the state actively overhauled the local post-war homeownership-welfare dynamic from the late 1970s. The analysis establishes how this refurbishment outdates Kemeny’s thesis by rendering features of the post-war homeownership model ineffective and, more significantly, by fashioning new homeowner subjectivities—namely, the investor subject. By bringing together Foucauldian perspectives (mortgage biopolitics) with Marxian political economy, this state-sensitive account both responds to Kemeny’s unexpected silence on the active hand of the Australian state in structuring its homeownership-welfare dynamic, and contributes to the asset-based welfare critique by emphasizing its post-1980s features and the structural drivers that explain its persistence, despite its unequal wealth and welfare outcomes. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",asset-based welfare; Australia; homeownership; housing policy; investor subject; welfare state,homeownership; housing conditions; housing management; housing market; housing policy; welfare economics; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046016389,0

We find that both the immediate and longer term outcomes of relocation varied greatly; while some people failed to settle and felt a loss of social relations, many others did not. People had agency, some chose to get away from tenement life and others chose to move on subsequently as aspirations changed. Furthermore, relocation to high-rise was not always the life-defining event or moment it is often depicted to be. Outcomes from relocation are mediated by many other events and experiences, questioning its role as an explanatory paradigm in housing studies. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",high-rise; oral history; re-study; Relocation; social outcomes; trajectories,historical perspective; housing provision; informal settlement; multistorey building; relocation; social history; trajectory; Glasgow [Scotland]; Scotland; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038246182,0

This paper contributes to the debate over the future of social housing in England by reviewing the Affordable Homes Programme (AHP). The AHP (2011–2015) saw the level of grant funding reduced dramatically; with the shortfall to be filled from housing associations own resources, increased rents and borrowing. To understand the implications of the AHP, this paper utilizes the concept of financialization. Financialization is a multifaceted process that seeks to explain the increased role and power of the financial markets in society. Specifically, the paper shows that the AHP leads to increased debt levels in the social housing sector, is predicated on short-termism and accumulation by dispossession. Finally, by employing financialization the paper also addresses debates about the nature of housing policy and how it can best be conceptualized. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Previous research has found that rent assistance recipients are less healthy than otherwise similar non-recipients in the cross-section, but the evidence about the effects of rent assistance on health in the long run is ambiguous. Our study uses panel survey data to compare the health of recipients and eligible non-recipients at the study’s onset and four years later at follow-up with respect to an extensive set of physical, mental and behavioural health outcomes. Our results demonstrate that rent assistance recipients are in worse overall health than non-recipients, but also provide suggestive evidence that the programme may buffer health declines in the medium term. However, the positive buffering effects may be erased in the long run, as we simultaneously observed an increase in smoking among rent assistance recipients. Our study shows that the current shortage of rent assistance may have implications for population health. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Health; health disparities; housing; rent; vouchers,housing; public health; rental sector; smoking; Detroit; Michigan; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044303366,1

When housing is unaffordable, households struggle to attain and maintain housing, which negatively effects household well-being. Since the foreclosure crisis, community land trusts (CLTs) have emerged as a viable housing policy. Relying on quantitative and qualitative data collected by a Minneapolis-based CLT, this study examines the experiences of 91 CLT homeowners. Our analysis illustrates how the CLT’s institutional framework alters the political, economic, social and material relations that characterize the lives of these households to facilitate the provision of previously unavailable resources.

Some of these housing initiatives have been marketed, while others have been scaled-up or co-opted by the state. Through a detailed discussion of changing government involvement in a rental cooperative neighbourhood in the Brussels Capital Region, and an analysis of participative practices, we discuss the relevance of the cooperative model today. Rather than an obsolete system, the paper shows that differential forms of commoning reproduce the cooperative model, resulting in capacity building and increased social capital among participating inhabitants.

Recognizing increased difficulties faced by the younger generation in the housing market, this paper highlights that support from older family members is increasingly important. Nonetheless, it is critiqued that the role of the family home has been largely ignored in the current ‘generation rent’ discourse. By drawing on recent youth studies debates, this paper argues living in the family home could be an important form of support in housing, especially for marginalized youth. This paper presents insights from qualitative studies in Hong Kong and Scotland and analyses interview accounts of socially disengaged young people. It reflects how remaining at the family home could be interpreted as intergenerational support, and further elicits complexities in expectations, negotiations and emotions involved.

Despite findings pointing towards a general atmosphere of cordiality and solidarity, interactions were casual, coexisted with prejudiced views towards certain groups and areas, and were viewed by residents as part of their everyday social practices of community.

Whether in Europe, North America, Africa, Asia or Latin America, community-based financial institutions have relied on deposits to make financial services accessible to moderate-income borrowers. Despite the foundational role savings and loans have had in financial sector development, emerging markets have largely overlooked the important role these institutions can have in providing shelter credit in their own contexts.

We report evidence of financial adequacy variation across five housing liquidation options and this is influenced by rent imputation. The results show that non-homeowners are less financially adequate than homeowners. We find that Māori, renters and individuals living in multi-dwelling occupancies have much lower levels of financial adequacy.

Studies of migrant populations in China have noted the existence of strong neighbourhood ties and solidarity in migrant communities, but few have examined whether strong neighbourhood cohesion enhances or hinders broader social integration of rural migrants. This article investigates the extent to which different types of social ties in the neighbourhood, as opposed to more social networks developed at the city level, predict more frequent intergroup interaction and stronger place attachment among rural migrants in Chinese cities. Statistical analysis, using data from a twelve-city migrant survey, reveals that, while the diversity of social networks does matter, the neighbourhood is a territorial anchor supporting, rather than dragging, the urban social integration of rural migrants.

Moreover, with an increase in living space, the mental health of rural migrants who live in private rental housing tends to improve significantly slower than rural migrants who live in dormitories. Furthermore, housing quality and housing location do not moderate the effect of housing ownership on the mental health of rural migrants.

Interviews with service providers revealed that high rents and low vacancy rates had profound impacts on program operations, and complicated efforts to follow HF principles. Clients often experienced delays in being housed and felt pressure to accept the first apartment they were offered. In response, HF programs devoted resources to improve relationships with landlords.

It proposes a new approach to defining and measuring housing affordability, based on the Minimum Income Standard (MIS). The paper then uses data from the Family Resources Survey (2008/09 to 2015/16) to examine housing affordability within the rented sector across the UK, exploring the value of this measure both in revealing the scale of the ‘problem’ and assessing the likely impact of suggested interventions. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Housing affordability; living standards; Minimum Income Standards; PRS; social housing,affordable housing; household income; living standard; rental sector; social housing; socioeconomic impact; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059007212,1

We examine whether the higher financial wealth of owners can be partly explained with increases in saving when becoming a homeowner in two distinct institutional contexts. Using longitudinal data for the UK (British Household Panel Survey) and Germany (Socio-Economic Panel Study), we find that homeowners save more and are financially wealthier than tenants. However, when controlling for time-constant selection into homeownership, upon entering homeownership households reduce their probability to save in Germany and reduce their average saving rate in Germany and the UK. For Germany, there is some evidence that processes of homemaking (family formation and home improvement) lead to less saving. For the UK, we find no evidence that increasing home equity over time discourages saving. Finally, tenants do not compensate for their lack of housing wealth by accumulating more non-housing wealth over time.

The paper demonstrates that most people can overcome the material dimension of liminality if they are given appropriate support, but they find it more difficult to overcome the relational and psychological dimensions of liminality. We conclude that moving on from long-term homelessness is not straightforward and we point to the policy implications of these findings. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Chronic homelessness; community integration; liminality; stigma,homelessness; housing policy; identification method; psychology; social housing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041333355,0

In this paper, ordered logit models are estimated, explaining satisfaction from neighbourhood characteristics, personal characteristics and interactions. These interactions test whether neighbourhood characteristics have similar effects on satisfaction for all individuals, or whether individual characteristics affect the size and direction of these effects. Satisfaction is found to be less affected by the share of ethnic minorities for ethnic minorities than for natives, because minorities are more satisfied in neighbourhoods with higher shares of their own ethnic group. Neighbourhood characteristics are found to have a stronger effect on satisfaction for owner-occupiers and parents with children than for others, however the impact of neighbourhood ethnic composition does not vary with tenure or household type. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

This heterogeneity is analysed by differentiating older adults on their lifestyles (operationalized as values), using latent class analysis as a clustering technique. These analyses result in older adults being classified into five segments on the basis of their viewpoints, motivations and attitude. Next, for each lifestyle segment a separate discrete choice model is estimated, offering insight in the relative importance that these segments give to various housing attributes.

Property investment discourse often takes the narrative form of the ‘property investment journey’, invoking Campbell’s ‘monomyth’ of the ‘hero’s journey’. It also presents a range of strategies of investment, underpinned by a common commitment to strategic thinking, and a rethinking of debt, such that an individual comes to know themselves through property investment.

It systematically analyses newspaper coverage, comparing two time periods, one relatively stable and the second a period of rising house prices. This analysis exposes the powerful influence of industry insiders in creating the discourse of the housing market news, and how price rises are positioned as both beneficial and the ‘natural order’. Analysing the metaphoric representations of housing markets allows a closer interrogation of the ideological construct that associates a ‘healthy’ housing market as one of continuous price rises and shows how these discourses are deeply embedded, in ways that limit the scope for imagining an alternative house market functioning. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",analysis of newspapers; critical discourse analysis; house price inflation; House prices,critical analysis; financial crisis; housing market; inflation; mass media; media role; price dynamics; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040969168,0

The interview-based data explains negotiations and other forms of information processing throughout the choice process, ending with unexpected choice outcomes. Despite the focus groups’ relative wide-ranging freedom of choice, residents constantly adjust their preferences as choice criteria throughout the decision-making process.

Drawing on interviews with women accessing homelessness services in the North of England, discussion interweaves women’s meanings of home and homelessness with the Freudian notion of the ‘unheimlich’. The ‘unheimlich’ captures the uncanny process of inversion whereby the familiar domestic sphere of the house turns into a frightening place; and a typical space of homelessness—the hostel—is considered home.

The markdown arises around 2004–2005, which coincides with the publication of detailed flood maps by the UK Environment Agency and with a more risk-based pricing of flood insurance policies. As expected, the effect of flood risk on house prices is stronger in the months following major flood events but, interestingly, it almost disappears in a hot market when buyers have arguably less negotiating power. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Floods; household behaviour; housing; UK land registry,flood; flooding; household structure; housing policy; insurance system; neighborhood; residential location; risk assessment; social housing; England; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037709636,0

Hong Kong is characterized by an executive-dominant planning system, whereby the government possesses strong planning powers, while elected district councillors play an advisory role only. Curiously, planning delays are fairly common. The above paradox is analysed in this paper through examining a major dispute over public housing development in Hong Kong. This dispute involved lengthy processes of bargaining, which were vulnerable to legitimacy challenges. Councillors acted strategically by tapping into prevailing social values to frame the legitimacy of bargaining processes. Despite discontent with these informal bargaining processes, the dispute has not evolved into more radical challenges to existing governance arrangements. The paper concludes by considering how hegemonic discourses of planning efficiency may have constrained the emergence of radical contention, which adds to broader debates about the conditions which shape the trajectories and transformative prospects of contentious urban developments. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","governance, framing analysis, Hong Kong; housing supply; Planning conflicts; public housing",bargaining; governance approach; housing project; planning process; planning system; residential development; urban development; China; Hong Kong,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031120776,0

By comparing homeowners vs. renters, we further discover that migrant homeowners are less likely to suffer extreme overcrowding than the native residents of China’s cities.

Co-residential domestic work foregrounds migrants’ need for a domestic space of their own, within the place of someone else. Building on immigrant women’s narratives, I explore what senses and dimensions of domesticity, or even of home, are negotiated in their routine interactions with older clients and the latter’s family members. Within a dwelling place which conflates work and domesticity, the cognitive, emotional and practical dimensions of migrants’ gendered home experience are nothing obvious. How is home-making–as a set of practices oriented to pursue security, familiarity and control–enacted under these circumstances? Is the cultivation of a sense of home beneficial to the clients only, or do immigrant women themselves feel at home somehow?

By analysing individual-level population register data on Sweden, we jointly examine the effects of micro- and macro-level home-ownership on individuals’ unemployment. The findings indicate that even though home-owners have a lower probability of being unemployed, there is a penalty for both renters and home-owners on unemployment in regions with high home-ownership rates. Differences in mobility patterns cannot explain this pattern.

This allows us to use methods that isolate the effects of changes in time spent homeless and time spent housed on psychological distress holding constant all unobserved person-specific effects that are time invariant. We find that the relationship between psychological distress and homelessness varies by gender and by type of homelessness. Males recently experiencing literal homelessness (i.e. sleeping rough or in crisis accommodation) exhibit the highest levels of distress, but consistent with the adaptation hypothesis, distress levels decline as homeless duration increases.

Our findings highlight the profound qualitative differences between regular transfers for establishing and retaining residential independence in the rental sector and inter vivos gifts for house purchase. Where the former support type is given and taken unconditionally, transfers for house purchase follow a different logic and carry different meanings. Being a necessary condition for property acquisition at young age, they have the power to completely rebalance family relations and undermine younger adults’ autonomy accordingly.

More recently, this mutuality has taken on a more critical salience as realignments in housing markets, employment and welfare states in many countries have worked together to undermine housing access for new households. In this context, families have become increasingly involved in smoothening the routes of young adults members up the ‘housing ladder’ into home ownership. Intergenerational support appears to have become much more widespread and not just confined to familialistic welfare regimes. The role of intergenerational support for housing remains, however, highly differentiated across countries, cities and regions, as well as uneven between social and income classes.

This paper contributes to this debate by investigating the influence of bequests and in-kind generational transfers on housing wealth pathways.

Still life-time renters are significantly missing out on inheritances. However, young people who are living with their parents are benefiting from this in-kind support in the long term and are able to purchase their first home earlier than independent mortgagers who are saving up for a deposit while renting.

Support received to acquire a home along one’s life course has an important demonstration effect: those parents who have received their home as a gift or have received economic support for buying it are more prone to provide help to their adult children.

Utilising data from a qualitative study of early housing pathways, this paper applies Lüscher’s theory of ambivalence in a context previously unexplored via this framework, analysing how participants talked about competing claims between siblings for finite parental resources in support of independent living. Most expressed faith in the assumed fairness of parental behaviours in providing support whilst often constructing themselves as ‘more responsible’ or ‘more deserving’ than their siblings. Whilst parental support was routinely made available regardless of recipients’ current housing tenure, there was nonetheless a sense that support for owner occupation fell into a distinct category of assistance, reinforcing notions of tenure prejudice. Given ongoing dependency on family support, participants were largely resigned to these disparities, regarding them as integral to the ambivalent nature of inter- and intragenerational family relationships. © 2017 The Author(s).

This could hinder social mobility and exacerbate inequality. Using data from three cohorts of young people drawn from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study of England and Wales, this study examines how parental attributes in childhood are linked to young adults’ housing outcomes two decades later. The results show that young adults’ housing outcomes have changed considerably over time and are persistently stratified by parental class and tenure in ways that vary by gender. Housing outcomes have become somewhat more polarised by parental tenure over time as the children of renters became relatively less likely to enter homeownership and more likely to rent privately. This suggests that renters became an increasingly ‘marginalised minority’ in the late twentieth century, with consequences for their children’s housing careers and future social inequality. © 2016 The Author(s).

The reasons for support for tenure mix included avoiding ghettoization, building community and social role modelling. The reasons for opposing tenure mix reflected a concern for the loss of public housing, a view that public and private tenants would not want to be co-located and that public tenants weren’t as deserving as others of living in a good inner city location.

It illustrates that security of tenure and cost of accommodation potentially has a profound impact on the psychological health of older Australians. Most of the older private renters told of being constantly stressed due to concerns about being given notice to vacate or an untenable rent increase. In contrast, the strong security of tenure and limited accommodation costs of older social housing tenants and homeowners created a foundation for a positive outlook and the capacity to lead a decent life. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Australia; health; housing tenure; Older people,elderly population; health status; homeowner; income; mental health; pension system; tenure system; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021675855,0

A key feature of UC is a change in the way the income-related housing allowance for social housing tenants (Housing Benefit) is administered, as under UC, it is paid directly to tenants (direct payment), who are responsible for paying their rent. This represents a step change for them as for more than 30 years landlord payment has been the norm in the UK. There has been little research into direct payment.

Sample data of 375 are conveniently drawn from walk-in customers of Islamic banks located in the biggest city Karachi. This study employed both exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to confirm the validity and reliability of the measurement model. The modified theoretical framework was examined by applying the structural equation modeling using frequently reported goodness-of-fit indices. The findings indicate that the original constructs of TPB model, attitude (ATT), subjective norm (SN) and perceived behavioral control has a positive and significant impact on the customer intention to use Islamic home financing. Furthermore, ATT is found to be the most influential factor in determining the customer intention toward Islamic home financing. On the other hand, we introduced two new factors, pricing on home financing (PHF) and religious belief (RB), which proved their presence in the TPB model by showing a significant impact on the customer intention to use the facility of home financing. In addition, PHF has a negative impact while religious belief has a positive relationship with the customer intention to use Islamic home financing in Pakistan. This study also suggests that the standard TPB model is successfully modified by introducing PHF and RB factors. Therefore, Islamic bank managers should consider this study to promote the Islamic home financing facility in Pakistan. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",customer intention; home financing; Islamic banks; Pakistan; Sharia,banking; cultural tradition; housing market; Islamism; modeling; price dynamics; statistical analysis; theoretical study; Karachi; Pakistan; Sind,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015240322,1

We examine the relationship between income poverty and housing pathways over an 18-year period to 2008, and develop consensual approaches to poverty estimation, housing deprivation, and the prevalence of under and over-consumption. We find that chronic poverty is most strongly associated with housing pathways founded in social renting, whereas housing pathways founded in owner-occupation are more strongly associated with temporary poverty. Whilst housing deprivation is disproportionately prevalent among those who experienced chronic poverty, the overwhelming majority of people who experienced chronic poverty avoided housing deprivation. This evidence supports of the notion that the housing system, during this period, weakened the link between poverty and housing deprivation.

But there is resistance amongst social landlords, many of whom remain committed to providing ‘homes for life’. Moreover, austerity-driven cuts mean that benefit-dependent households are increasingly refused social tenancies on grounds of affordability. The stage is therefore set for a battle over who and what English social housing is for. Drawing on large-scale qualitative research, this paper interrogates the implications of the mandatory extension of fixed-term tenancies (FTTs) by considering landlord and tenant experiences of the discretionary FTT regime in place since 2012. We conclude that the meagre likely benefits of FTTs, in terms of marginally increased tenancy turnover, are heavily outweighed by the detrimental impacts on tenants’ ontological security and landlords’ administrative burden. © 2017 The Author(s).

Multi-level modelling techniques have been applied to a longitudinal survey of 788 private sector landlords who had LHA tenants in 19 Local Authorities across GB. The analysis shows that whilst landlords were affected by reforms, area effects were not as pronounced as anticipated. In general, landlords were equally affected regardless of where they operate. The findings suggest tenants in the most affected areas have absorbed increases in their rent shortfall signifying income was not the overriding determinant of demand. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",area effects; Housing allowances; private rented sector; welfare reform,affordable housing; housing reform; landowner; private land; private sector; rental sector; welfare reform; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013113392,1

Second, having a current drug or alcohol dependency, but no diagnosed mental health disorder or long-term physical health issue, is not associated with higher level health care costs.

Furthermore, when moving to a gated neighbourhood, voluntary movers are more likely than forced movers to participate in public activities, to have more contact with new neighbours and thereby to get more help from the residents’ committee and new neighbours.

A significant element of this growth occurred post-2006 and may be attributed to issues associated with the housing boom and bust. As economic recovery gets underway, severe supply constraints have emerged, putting pressure on the PRS. This paper presents findings of a national survey of landlords undertaken at this time, the first of its kind in Ireland. Despite the current difficulties being experienced in the Irish rental market over 60 per cent of landlords intend to remain in the sector. The survey points to policy changes that could help provide a more stable rental market, for example, the provision of unfurnished accommodation and longer leases. With approximately one-third of landlords expressing the intention to leave, maintaining supply remains a key challenge for the sector. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Ireland; landlords; policy; Private rented; survey,housing policy; landownership; private sector; public attitude; rental sector; survey method; Ireland,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989244153,0

Nonetheless, the private rented sector (PRS) has been commonly portrayed as a tenure option for tenants rather than a welfare strategy for landlords. Drawing on qualitative interviews with landlords across Great Britain, we explore landlords’ different motivations in engaging in landlordism; and the ways in which their property-based welfare strategies are shaped by the particular intersection of individual socioeconomic and life-course circumstances, and the broader socioeconomic and financial environment.

Hitherto, the theory has, as Neil Smith intended, been used in an economic sense; we argue here, borrowing ideas from Pierre Bourdieu, that in the competitive environment of Chinese education, a rent gap in cultural capital is created which can later be converted into economic capital. The process we identify is triggered by the purchase of an apartment in a catchment zone, crucial to obtaining entry into a prestigious ‘key’ school in most Chinese cities. This leads to apartments changing hands for high prices despite generally being old and dilapidated. The rent gap in cultural capital occurs when parents forego potential short-term gains to capitalize on the long-term benefits of a superior education. This is contrasted here with a somewhat more conventional scenario, where property developers exploit a rent gap on suburban apartments built in the catchment of branch ‘key’ schools. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",catchment zones; cultural capital; key schools; Rent gap theory; work unit housing,catchment; education; gentrification; urban housing; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988632817,0

Yet, ethnic residential segregation is stated as being a major social problem in these countries. Neighbourhood flight and avoidance behaviour among the native born could be a sign of less tolerant views on minorities, but could of course be restricted to native-born residents in areas of high-ethnic concentration. So far, no research in these countries has explicitly focused on the majority population’s view on segregation, and we know little about how native-born residents in different neighbourhood contexts view ethnic segregation or how own residential experience shapes decisions on staying or leaving; this paper aims to help fill this research lacuna. In a survey targeting 9000 native-born residents in three Nordic capital cities—stratified into neighbourhood movers and stayers and into neighbourhoods having different proportions of non-Nordic-born residents—we answer three questions: do native-born respondents prefer a neighbourhood ethnic mix? Do they see ethnic segregation as a problem? Do they prefer lower, current or higher shares of ethnic minorities in their own neighbourhoods? © 2016 The Author(s).

Since 2007, the state has pursued a public housing revival, laying out various responsibilities for local governments to develop public housing. However, until recently, confronted with significant shortfalls in fiscal and land inputs, local authorities were largely unable to activate construction on an adequate scale. Nonetheless, between 2011 and 2013, the city of Chongqing applied a mode to supply public rental housing on a massive scale. This paper examines the administrative structure and reforms that have ensured the execution of the Chongqing programme. Findings show that specific political and economic incentives of the local officials have played important roles for realising the programme. Moreover, the municipality’s control of land supply and the market have also enabled an efficient cooperation between governmental and market actors for public housing provision. © 2017 The Author(s).

Second, social upgrading and homogenization began in the 1990s, and the ‘ideal’ social mix was a temporary phase before upper socio-professional groups became overrepresented. The growing availability and diversification of social housing has neither created a greater social mix nor slowed down social upgrading, either in general or for social housing in particular.

Using a combination of interviews with HAs and institutional investors and a round table discussion, the study shows how such investment has facilitated HAs as hybrid organisations which adopt a pragmatically ‘fit-for-purpose’ approach that combines social benefit with profitability. For institutional investors, investing in social housing is a profit-oriented business as well as a corporate social activity that creates public relations benefits. Importantly, the study shows how government regulations can affect the form of institutional investment (bond finance rather than equity investment) in social housing and help HAs balance the opportunities and risks in combining business and social orientations. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Bond finance; equity investment; pension funds; regulation; sale and leaseback,business; finance; investment; profitability; regulatory framework; social housing; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978759447,0

This absence belies their prevalence and growing centrality within practices of family and home, and persists despite evidence of links between companion animals and rental insecurity. This paper begins to address this gap. Through an online survey and in-depth interviews with people who rented with companion animals in Sydney, Australia, over the 10 years to 2013, the paper identifies connections between pet ownership and rental insecurity, including perceptions about the low availability and poor quality of advertised ‘pet-friendly’ properties. The paper argues that pet ownership can trigger feelings of rental insecurity, and advocates for inclusion of pet ownership as a variable impacting secure occupancy. It suggests companion animals are an escalating rental risk, their significance to their owners causing some to accept accelerating levels of rental insecurity by keeping pets without landlord knowledge. These experience impact on the ability of renters to feel ‘at home’ in rental properties. © 2016 The Author(s).

Inclination among natives to move away from neighbourhoods dominated by ethnic minorities has been called ‘White Flight’ in the literature, and disposition to avoid them ‘White Avoidance’. Preferences among ethnic minorities for living together with kinsmen or countrymen might create an inclination to move into multi-ethnic neighbourhoods, in this paper called ‘Ethnic Attraction’, or to remain there, called ‘Ethnic Retention’. This paper estimates the importance and size of these four kinds of behaviour based on an extensive database from Denmark using new statistical methods. It is concluded that white avoidance is the strongest reason for spatial concentrations of Non-Western ethnic minorities followed by ethnic attraction.

Increasing demand from higher and lower income households has occurred alongside increasing concentration of supply in mid-market segments. The paper discusses possible explanations of this mismatch. It suggests that middle/higher income households rent through a mixture of constraint and choice in areas with a high level of amenity, adding to understanding of gentrification of inner-city areas. Urban restructuring, evident in increased land values in inner areas of large cities, has resulted in limited ‘filtering down’ of older housing into low-rent private rental stock and a concentration of investment in supply in mid-market segments with greatest prospects for resale and rental. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Australia; gentrification; home ownership; Housing markets; private rented housing; urbanisation,gentrification; homeownership; household income; housing market; private sector; rental sector; urban housing; urbanization; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84976273914,0

It has since been renamed, and is now known as the ‘rent rebate system’. A number of dilemmas have become evident since the 2006 changes. Attention has shifted to how to implement the system effectively: how to limit the overconsumption of housing services, how to avoid moral hazard, how to reduce outright fraud, how to reduce the poverty trap, and how to prevent the escalation of public spending. These new dilemmas have led to the central research question in this article: how to redesign a system of rent rebates? The discussion of these dilemmas points to further changes.

First, the widely used Esping-Andersen (EA) approach assesses only a subset of the key housing outcomes and may be less helpful for describing changes in housing policy regimes. Second, there is too much emphasis on tenure transitions, and an assumed close correspondence between tenure labels and effective system functioning may not be valid. Third, due attention has not been given to the spatial dimensions in which housing systems operate, in particular when housing policies have a significant devolved or localised emphasis. Updating EA’s framework, we suggest a preliminary list of housing system indicators in order to capture the nature of the housing systems being developed and devolved.

Various problems have been raised with this explanation for the ethnic gap in homeownership rates. This paper responds to these criticisms by sensitizing the financial constraints explanation to the possibility of differential effects of ethnicity depending upon level of income. The hypothesis that the ethnic gap is stronger for lower income groups is tested through logistic analyses of the housing tenure of Turkish and Moroccan immigrants and a comparison group of native citizens in the Netherlands. High-income Turks are revealed to have comparable rates of homeownership to high-income natives, whereas in low-income groups a large ethnic gap exists. The ethnic gap in homeownership among low-income groups could not be explained by other financial constraints (education, couple’s earning status, parental resources). Housing preferences and discrimination are possible explanations for this ethnic gap among low-income households. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Ethnic minorities; homeownership; income,ethnic minority; ethnicity; homeownership; immigrant; income distribution; low income population; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969204040,1

As devolution has evolved there has been a greater trend towards divergence in housing policy, which calls into question any notion of a ‘UK experience’. Whilst the 2014 Scottish independence referendum again returned constitutional reform high onto the political agenda, there still remain tensions between devolved governments and the UK Government in Westminster, with England increasingly becoming the outlier in policy terms. Informed by ideas of social constructionism, which emphasises the politics of housing, this paper draws on an analysis of policy narratives to highlight the need for greater geographical sensitivity. This requires not only more spatial nuance, but also a recognition that these differences are underpinned by divergent political narratives in different parts of the UK.

A central feature of the discussion surrounding the implementation of these changes was to question the rights associated with ownership of strata.

Analysis of these interviews demonstrates the complex ways in which property rights are understood in relation to strata termination within the broader context of housing.

We find that maintenance issues may cause stress and anxiety, thereby rupturing affective ties to place, limiting access to preferred identities and reducing well-being.

In all three countries, a variety of interrelated factors appear to encourage greater propensities for homeownership amongst co-residential households (married/cohabiting), as compared to single-person households. However, important macro-contextual differences do appear to play a significant role in mediating the magnitude of difference within this hierarchy. For instance, in Germany the importance of marriage as a predictor of homeownership is found to be particularly strong, with married couples having far higher propensities for homeownership, even when compared to non-married cohabiters.

Through a Foucauldian lens, this paper discusses surveillance of rural migrants and studies a new local approach called rental housing management (RHM). During recent years, local authorities in Dongguan have been developing RHM into an operation of incremental Panopticism that consists of gradually reinforced surveillance techniques—partitioning, monitoring, digital entrance guarding, and local registration—in retrofitted rental residences. The RHM enforces local authorities’ inspection and control of migrants, and induces migrants’ self-reporting, self-inspection, and self-protection. This creates difficulties with migrants’ social interaction and community building. This paper reveals that local authorities have been transforming surveillance approaches from management based on hukou (household registration) into RHM that furthers localized spatial governance of rural migrants in the hukou reform. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",hukou; incremental Panopticism; Rental housing; rural migrants; surveillance,governance approach; housing management; migration; policy reform; rental sector; rural area; surveillance and enforcement; China; Dongguan; Guangdong,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963823315,0

Within England, an increasing number of housing associations (HAs) has looked for new forms of investment, notably from private rental housing, to generate additional cash flows and fill gaps in the housing market. Drawing on the concepts of institutional logics and organisational hybridity, the paper uses organisational archetypes to examine the different hybrid financing, governance structures and housing products that two pioneering London-based HAs have employed to undertake private rental activities alongside their social businesses.

While this shift has helped raise the net worth of some among the middle and working classes who own property, the implications for the spatial distribution of wealth in cities have not yet been explored. This paper examines the spatial implications of the rise of policies promoting asset-based welfare, by examining statistically how variables related to homeownership rates and housing prices relate to measures of urban wealth segregation among neighbourhoods. Canadian cites are used as the main case study for the empirical analysis. The findings suggest that while homeownership in general has an equalizing effect, rising rates of homeownership (and to some extent, rising house prices) are associated not with greater spatial equalization and dispersal of wealth, but instead with greater spatial segregation and concentration of wealth within cities. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",asset-based welfare; Homeownership; housing markets; housing policy; neighbourhoods; residential segregation; urban inequality; wealth,homeownership; housing market; housing policy; income distribution; neighborhood; social segregation; Canada,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963594959,0

The underlying idea is that street segment connectivity captures fine variations in homebuyers’ preferences for the location. The advantage of the approach is that it is spatially fine grained; it uses the street segment, intuitively the most fundamental spatial unit for spatial housing market analysis; it allows the use of statistical tests to optimize within-submarket similarities, identifying spatial groups of street segments with the most similar accessibility features; it avoids the predefined arbitrary geographic boundaries usually used in spatial submarket delineation; it increases the variability of accessibility information in submarket delineation, accessibility being the principal spatial determinant of housing price; and it allows for normalized measures of accessibility at different spatial scales making it appropriate for comparative analysis across cities and across time. Using a case study of Cardiff, UK, we compare the results with a market segmentation scheme based on prior-knowledge, notably one relying on building-type classification. We conclude that street layout can be used to efficiently delineate housing submarkets, and that the estimation is very close to the scheme requiring prior-knowledge.

Existing approaches, relying on socio-economic factors, demographics, culture or housing policy, cannot explain the persistence of these differences in homeownership. This article fills this explanatory gap by making a path-dependence argument: it argues that nineteenth-century urban conditions either began to create the American suburbanized single-family house cities or compact multi-unit-building cities, as in Germany. US cities developed differently from German ones because they lacked feudal shackles, were governed as “private cities” and gave easier access to mortgages and building land. The more historically suburbanized a city, the lower its homeownership rate today. Economic and political reinforcing mechanisms kept the two countries on their paths.

There has been little examination of why older people make choices to age in particular places in later life. In this paper, we drew on 143 interviews with older people in New Zealand to examine the narratives older people use to describe their housing preferences in later life. Older people drew upon personal and public narratives to story housing in later life, and construct four identifiable identities: ‘practical planner’, ‘rugged pioneer’, ‘where I belong’ and ‘rooted in place’. This analysis demonstrates that some older people do narrate decisions to age in ‘sensible’ places with good access to services and have clear plans for change as their physical health declines. Other older people live proudly in unsuitable places and do not wish for support to move or accommodations made to their housing. These older people draw upon narratives of place as foundational to their identity, of relationships with people both living and dead as social relationships that bolster their identity and of housing as part of situated lifelong narratives. Both the situation of their home and the condition of the home provide the backdrop to alternative narrative identities that require them to remain in housing because of, or irrespective of, its unsuitability. To understand the limitations and the possibilities of ageing in place, we need to identify the multiple narratives that structure the lives of older people. By doing so, we can support ageing in place processes that do not disrupt the strong identities that have been developed in and through housing. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Ageing in place; housing; identity; older people,elderly care; elderly population; housing provision; identity construction; social housing; New Zealand,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84950145331,0

First, while spatial segregation patterns of home-leavers were clear, inter-generational mobility did take place, supporting the notion of straight-line assimilation. Second, inter-generational effects were identified. While there was no indication that parental socio-economic situation affected the spatial segregation of home-leavers, substantial effects were found for the share of ethnic minorities in the parental neighbourhood: the higher the share of ethnic minorities, the higher the hazard for moving to an ethnic neighbourhood and the lower the hazard for moving to a non-ethnic neighbourhood. Similarity in the patterns of natives and the ethnic minority groups indicates that the processes taking place might be about more than assimilation between generations. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",leaving home; migration; Neighbourhoods; residential mobility; spatial assimilation; straight-line assimilation,acculturation; comparative study; ethnic minority; immigrant; migration; neighborhood; racial segregation; residential mobility; Denmark,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947904815,1

In this paper, we draw upon inspections data in Vancouver to both estimate the size of the problem and detail how it is observed and constituted through municipal regulatory processes. We contrast the inspections approach to residential clutter with the mental health approach, which focuses on hoarding disorder. Inspections data indicate the problem of residential clutter is potentially larger than might be expected by the epidemiology of hoarding disorder, and also point toward the many risks associated with clutter. Using our best estimate, approximately seven per cent of low-income, dense, single-room occupancy (SRO) housing units inspected were identified by inspectors as problematically cluttered, indicating a sizable problem. Larger buildings and those managed as social housing were more likely than other buildings to have many units identified as problematically cluttered. Strikingly, for given buildings, estimates of problematic clutter tended to remain relatively stable across time, inspector, and inspection method. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",clutter; hazards; hoarding; homelessness; Housing policy; property condition,homelessness; housing policy; low income housing; regulatory framework; residential location; residential satisfaction; social housing; British Columbia; Canada; Vancouver [British Columbia],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977490647,1

This article uses critical discourse analysis to examine how ‘negative gearing’ is criticised and legitimised. It is argued that the interests of the property-owning majority and electoral pragmatism determine government housing policy. There is a disjunct between the political imperative of the major parties to maintain high housing prices in order not to erode the wealth of the majority of voters (property owners) and the emerging problem of housing unaffordability. Despite mounting coherent critique coming from economists, and younger cohorts excluded from home ownership, the policy continues due to realpolitik considerations. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",housing affordability; housing policy; Negative gearing,affordable housing; homeownership; housing market; housing policy; income; investment; rental sector; tax system; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941710856,0

These control mechanisms may also involve direct or indirect provision of support and care to some tenants. This illustrates the complex relationship between care and control and the extent to which both are integral to the housing management of vulnerable tenants living in HMOs.

Two approaches in the field of behavioral experimental testing were used to measure the degree of discrimination/selection: a telephone and an email approach. In both approaches, a different experimental design was applied, with fictitious applicants for each discrimination ground and the control group. The fictional rental home seekers asked the landlord—by phone or e-mail—if the vacant dwelling was still available and if they could make an appointment for a visit. In the telephone approach, a sample of 684 online ads was used in a paired-testing design, in which the landlords were contacted by both the control and experimental applicant. In the e-mail approach, a random-assignment design with a sample of 1769 online advertisements was used. The analyses revealed that discrimination for getting an appointment is found for each discrimination/selection ground in the email approach (only results for men), whereas people with Moroccan/Turkish names and disabled people were not found to be discriminated in the telephone approach. Furthermore, gender proved to be an important factor, as men with a Moroccan/Turkish background were discriminated in the phone-call approach (in contrast to women), whereas regarding financial means, women were treated more negatively than men. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Belgium; discrimination; field experiment; Rental market,disability; ethnicity; experiment; gender; housing market; rental sector; Belgium,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941359789,1

Housing is central to asset-based welfare policies, which may enable households to efficiently manage life course risks, but may exacerbate wealth inequality and expose them to market volatility. Australia presents an important case for understanding the dynamics of asset-based welfare, with its retirement approach combining high homeownership rates and a limited public pension. This paper investigates emerging generational differences in homeownership in Australia. Recent research has identified declining homeownership amongst younger cohorts. Using cross-sectional data, we explore alternative theoretical explanations for this trend. We find no evidence that declining homeownership reflects changing investment choices or delayed family formation. Instead, recent trends are consistent with intensifying inequalities based on class and care responsibilities. This casts doubt on the viability of Australia as a homeownership society and asset-based retirement policies in a financialised economy. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Asset-based welfare; generational equity; homeownership; retirement policy; wealth inequality,equity; homeownership; housing; retirement; social policy; welfare provision; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941334035,1

Since the mid-1990s, Kemeny’s model of ‘unitary’ and ‘dualist’ rental markets and Harloe’s classification of ‘mass’ and ‘residual’ social housing provision have been repeatedly recycled in comparative studies of ‘social’ and ‘public’ housing provision. Amidst international neoliberal policy mobilities, their models based on liberal welfare regimes wield particular power. Conceived during neoliberal cutbacks of public services, Kemeny’s ‘dualist’ rental market and Harloe’s ‘residual’ model of social housing similarly depict state-subsidised rental housing provision as bureaucratic, and targeted to the poor. Despite empirical change, these models are still used to describe liberal welfare regimes, and to theorise international policy convergence. Based on a review of recent market-oriented reforms of state-subsidised rental housing provision in the US, Australia and England; original neoliberal ‘sites of production’, this contribution asks whether these conceptual models still reflect the empirics. Findings diverge from the models, undermining their assumptions about how neoliberal reforms progress. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",affordable rental housing; Comparative housing; concept development; housing policy,affordable housing; homeowner; housing policy; rent seeking; social housing; Australia; England; United Kingdom; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941243059,0

Rather than liberal policies, the article argues that between the 1920s and 1970s, government subsidies slowly expanded, in terms of generosity, variety and universal availability, to such a scale that Ireland’s home ownership regime was effectively ‘socialised’. This regime (not market forces) raised home ownership to 80 per cent of households. However, ideological, financial and socio-economic supports for this regime weakened and during the 1980s home ownership was marketised as universal subsidies were withdrawn and mortgage lending privatised. The implications of this redirection were initially disguised by low house price inflation, but when the economy boomed in the 1990s home ownership contracted sharply to levels which could be supported solely by the market. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",housing policy; housing tenure; path dependence,government; homeownership; housing market; housing policy; institutional framework; mortgage lending; neoliberalism; price dynamics; socialism; socioeconomic status; tenure system; Ireland,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939148136,0

The intention has been to boost land and property values by transforming both the physical appearance and the sociocultural and class composition of selected sites. But while the impact, the rationale and the outcomes of urban regeneration in Turkey are broadly similar to those reported in the substantial global literature on ‘urban regeneration’, a case-study approach shows that a number of crucial context-specific factors have shaped the assumption and responses of key players and collective actors.

In it, settled power structures and collective ideologies are necessary prerequisites for the creation of distinctive housing welfare regimes with clear roles for the state, market and households. Although the defining feature of post-socialist housing has been mass-privatisation to create super-homeownership societies, the emphatic retreat of the state that this represents has not been replaced by the creation of the institutions or cultures required to create fully financialised housing markets. There is, instead, a form of state legacy welfare in the form of debt-free home-ownership, which creates a gap in housing welfare that has been partially filled by households in the form of intergenerational assistance (familialism) and self-build housing. Both of these mark continuities with the previous regime. The latter is especially common in south-east Europe where its frequent illegality represents a form of anti-state housing. The lack of settled ideologies and power structures suggests that these housing welfare regimes by default will persist as part of a process that resembles a path-dependent ‘transformation’ rather than ‘transition’. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",financialisation; housing policy; transition; Welfare regimes,conceptual framework; homeownership; housing market; housing reform; post-communism; socialism; welfare economics; Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955209729,0

Using data from 24 qualitative interviews with residents of both tenures, we provide a descriptive account of conditions in the redeveloped portion of the neighbourhood, describe resident experiences and attitudes towards the policy of tenure mix, and assess the proposition that tenure mix can benefit residents of public housing. We find that tenure mix enjoys strong support from residents of both tenures, particularly among a subset of market residents, and find indirect evidence that tenure mix has increased the social capital of some tenants.

However, a remarkable increase in the number of skilled migrants has been witnessed with the economic restructuring. Reforms in the labour and housing market have shifted the spatial arrangement of opportunities, consequently changing migrants' access to the cities. Using 2000 Population Census and employing spatial regression models, this study shows skilled migrants to have better access to the city in the sense that their residences locate in the areas with more professional jobs and better houses. It is their advantages in the labour market that determines their favoured access to the public sector housing, resulting in better residential locations. Female skilled migrants are less likely than males to settle in areas with a large proportion of urban village housing or shared accommodation.

Beyond these property-related stressors, the changes in survey participants' self-reported sense-of-control and mental, physical, and general health are most associated with transitions in employment, income, marital status, and residential quality rather than with loan modifications or foreclosure sales.

Drawing on interviews with representatives of 48 organizations, it identifies three spatial preferences regarding reconstruction: urban, non-urban, and mixed. Organizations favoring urban versus non-urban rebuilding differed markedly in their financial resources and voice. Many intergovernmental organizations and large international non-governmental organizations (NGOs)—the organizations that most favored non-urban rebuilding—held relatively anti-urban perspectives. Small international and Haitian NGOs were more likely to see Port-au-Prince as a suitable site for reconstruction and express positive opinions about urban conditions more generally. The findings indicate that much of the formal housing reconstruction effort, particularly as led by large, well-funded and politically powerful organizations, will be directed to the urban periphery and countryside. This suggests Port-au-Prince may continue to face the same challenges of unplanned growth that have led some organizations to find it an undesirable setting for reconstruction in the first place. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",disaster; earthquake; Haiti; Housing; Port-au-Prince; reconstruction,disaster management; housing project; nongovernmental organization; reconstruction; urban housing; Haiti,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948570809,0

Employing a qualitative case study method, the study finds that urban housing policy for renter households was defined by an ad hoc approach with multiple shifts over a period of 4 years. The improvised policy eventually lead to the creation of a publicly funded homeownership program that could rehouse less than one-third of impacted renters, whereas issues of equity, land tenure, lack of affordable units, and uncertainty of recovery for the poorest renters in the city remained. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",disaster recovery; housing policy; India; renters,disaster management; earthquake event; homeowner; housing policy; rental sector; urban housing; Bhuj; Gujarat; India,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948570805,0

This paper explores the example of social housing procurement in Northern Ireland, and the requirement to form mandated procurement groups. The research shows that the exercise of hierarchical power is still important in network governance; that mandated partnerships alter the balance between trust and power in partnership working, but the impact is uneven; and that these relationships are (re)shaping the ‘hybrid’ identity of housing associations. The balance between accountability for public resources and the independence of third sector organisations is the key tension in mandated partnerships. The Northern Ireland experience suggests that trust-based networks could provide more productive working relationships in partnerships for service delivery. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Housing associations; housing investment; hybrid organisations; network governance; Northern Ireland; social housing procurement,governance approach; investment; partnership approach; public service; social housing; Northern Ireland; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947130007,0

This paper seeks to redress this imbalance and examines the experiences of women who have lengthy homeless histories based on the accounts of 34 women who are participants in a larger biographical study of homeless women in Ireland. Women's movements into and out of homeless service settings are examined in some detail, as are their accounts of the lived experience of prolonged homelessness. Their narratives reveal their mothering roles and identities, intimate relationships and intimate partner violence, and their ongoing interactions with institutional settings, including homeless hostels, as key dynamics influencing their movements and the strategies used by them as they attempt to manage their homelessness.

This paper sets out to expand the geography of gentrification by looking at the representation of processes and policies of gentrification as put forward by key stakeholders in Nord-Neukölln (Berlin) and Indische Buurt (Amsterdam). It shows that in both contexts, stakeholders and policy documents engage with the concept of gentrification, rather than avoid it. Due to public-policy influence and local criticisms, this engagement differs between both cases. In Nord-Neukölln, the term is heavily contested and policy-makers attempt to refute accusations of gentrification, while in the Indische Buurt, the process is explicitly pursued as a positive policy instrument by policy-makers. Different representations within each case are shown to be influenced by the characteristics of in-moving and out-moving residents; the employed timeframe and the perceived influence of institutions on urban regeneration. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",discourse; Gentrification; housing policy; representation; social mixing; urban regeneration,gentrification; housing policy; policy making; stakeholder; urban renewal; urban society; Amsterdam [North Holland]; Berlin; Germany; Netherlands; North Holland,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947126466,0

In this paper, I argue that an appreciation of the roles performed by interest groups and lobbyists is necessary to understand not only how housing policies are determined, but also how they are maintained. The paper begins by setting out the context of Australian housing policy-making and the arrangements currently in place. Drawing upon interviews with influential lobbyists and policy advisors, the main part of the paper considers: the tactics deployed to inform policy-making, recent examples of successful interventions, the tensions between welfare and industry lobbyists and the barriers that undermine reform. The final part considers the wider significance of the lobbying process and its relevance for future research. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Australia; housing policy; Lobbying; welfare,housing policy; lobbying; policy making; welfare reform; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947037559,0

In recent years, the private rented sector (PRS) in Britain has grown in size after many years of decline; and the formal rules and informal practices that characterize this tenure have also changed significantly. This transformation began during the 1990s but the pace of change increased from the turn of the century and accelerated still further during the GFC.

This diversity of responses points to the under-valued attribute of PHAs as local organizations with diverse mandates.

It starts with the assumptions that housing and community development issues are linked to the wider housing market and that the housing crisis is not new but has long-run antecedents. The paper begins by reviewing the contemporary terrain of housing markets and policies in the UK. It then discusses several aspects of ‘crisis’: market volatility, rates of new supply, affordability, state welfare subsidies and socio-spatial inequalities. Policy responses to these are examined through a discussion of efforts to expand the role of the private rented sector, sell-off ‘expensive’ public housing and curtail market renewal investments. The paper concludes that current conceptualisations of the value of housing are often partial and insufficiently integrative and that policies must explicitly recognise housing as a social and economic asset. © 2014 The Author(s).

Homeownership restricts people to homogeneous neighborhoods, renders low-income families and renters of all types unacceptable, makes neighborhoods fertile ground for learning who is socially undesirable, breeds class-based distinctions, and puts people in financially risky situations.

This system is specific to South Korea and became dominant at the end of the twentieth century when it accounted for almost two-thirds of the rental market and almost 30 per cent of all housing. In the past decade, however, there have been marked declines in the number of chonsei tenancies along with a rise in other hybrid forms of renting.

More recently, the liberal discourses of the ‘ownership society’ have been conflated with the neo-liberalisation of welfare to restructure the socio-political ideology of ownership around accumulation and decumulation of housing wealth. This paper analyses findings from a new qualitative study to explore the tensions that this shift has created for owner-identities. Equity release transactions provide a prime context to explore the role of homeownership ideologies on participation in asset-based welfare: these are conceived as products that enable older owners to de-cumulate housing equity while continuing to occupy their homes and retaining the ‘badge’ of ownership. This paper focuses on the impact of housing wealth decumulation through equity release on the meanings of the owned home and to reflect on the role of feelings about ownership on participation in asset-based welfare. © 2015, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Asset-based welfare; debt; equity release; meanings of home,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84936891487,0

This study argues that social contacts and interactions in the neighbourhood are the minimal condition for these mechanisms to operate. Following this argument, this study examines whether these particular mechanisms will operate more strongly, and thus whether the magnitude of neighbourhood effects will be higher, for individuals who are socially more embedded in their neighbourhood. These conditional neighbourhood effects upon social embeddedness in the neighbourhood are examined for 3272 individuals within 246 neighbourhoods in the Netherlands. Surprisingly, it is found that the association between neighbourhood's socio-economic conditions and resident's income is not different for individuals with a different degree of neighbourhood-specific social contacts and interactions. Consequently, this study challenges the core of the neighbourhood effects argument on socio-economic outcomes by questioning the often applied socialisation and resources mechanisms. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Effect heterogeneity; Mechanisms; Neighbourhood effects; Social networks; Socialisation,heterogeneity; income; neighborhood; social network; socioeconomic conditions; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931575644,0

The preponderance of plausibly causal evidence from Europe and North America indicates that disadvantaged individuals are (1) harmed by the presence of sizable disadvantaged groups concentrated in their neighborhood and (2) helped by the presence of more advantaged groups in their neighborhood, probably due to positive role modeling, stronger collective control over disorder, and violence and elimination of geographic stigma, not cross-class social ties. Thus, there is a sufficient evidentiary base to justify the goal of social mix on grounds of improving the absolute well-being of the disadvantaged. This goal should be achieved by voluntary, gradualist, housing option-enhancing strategies that over the longer term expand opportunities for lower income families to live in communities with households of greater economic means. We advocate for these approaches because they impose fewer hardships on the disadvantaged and, hopefully, are also more effective over time. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",mixed-income housing; neighborhood effects; Social mix,income distribution; low income population; neighborhood; policy making; urban housing; violence; Europe; North America,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931566129,0

They do not suggest that access to services is worse in deprived neighbourhoods for all services, but only for a minority.

We apply a difference-in-difference model to estimate the effect using Danish longitudinal data on individual level for 1989–2006. We find that area-based intervention has no significant effect on social mix neither in respect to mix of educational background, employment mix, income mix nor ethnic mix. Instead, we find a strong residential selection as residents moving out of treated neighbourhoods have a Danish origin, a stronger affiliation to labour market and a higher disposable income compared to residents moving in treated neighbourhoods. This demonstrates that residents moving in are more socio-economically vulnerable than those residents moving out. We conclude that area-based intervention becomes shorthanded when it comes to increasing social mix because area-based intervention is up against a strong residential selection in moving pattern. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",area-based intervention; effect; neighbourhoods; Social housing; social mix,differentiation; housing conditions; modeling; neighborhood; social housing; urban housing; Denmark,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931562094,1

Due to the economic recession and the broader context of neoliberal globalization, there has been an observed delay among post-youth adults in their progression through the life-course. Many of the life-course transitions including leaving parental home, family formation and purchasing home, which used to occur earlier in people's 20s, now often occur in their 30s. Thus the 30-somethings are a transitional cohort and women in particular are more likely to experience a profound impact in the context of economic deflation and deregulation. Drawing on qualitative data obtained through fieldwork, this article examines how women's diversified life-courses are shaping their housing choices; and how their housing opportunities are shaped by the wider structures of housing markets and institutions.

Conceptually, the paper uses Young's critiques of residential segregation and the integration ideal to evaluate the two communities. Methodologically, it draws on qualitative interviews with residents, planners and social housing providers. The research findings contradict many aspects of Young's ideal and highlight the complex and multidimensional nature of integration in practice. Reflecting on these findings, the paper identifies five housing policy and research priorities that might usefully be pursued in future work. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",housing policy; Mixed tenure communities; New Gorbals; Poundbury; traditional urbanism,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928212764,0

The paper draws on 77 in-depth interviews with young people who had lived away from their families in the Australian out-of-home care system. The paper applies a psycho-social conceptualisation of ‘home’ to argue that home was a crucial symbol through which these young people imagined a less challenging future and claimed identities of ‘being normal’. The majority remembered their time in out-of-home care as a time of instability and insecurity in terms of both housing and relationships; they did not feel at home in these contexts. These histories informed young people's experiences and imagining of home and their sense of identity within and after out-of-home care, as they defined home as fundamentally different from out-of-home care. Their definitions incorporated shelter, emotional well-being, control, routine, caring relationships and stability. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",foster care; Home; ontological security; out-of-home care; placement instability,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928211054,0

Across the developed world, homelessness prevention is being pursued with vigour alongside existing homelessness interventions and yet there has been no pause for a systematic evaluation of how prevention fits alongside existing systems. Wales provides the first case where homelessness services have been systematically reviewed since the prevention turn. This paper critically examines the implementation of homelessness prevention in Wales, identifying how deficiencies echo emerging global concerns about the prevention turn. Drawing upon evidence gathered during a review of homelessness legislation in Wales, the paper examines the extent to which emerging proposals for legislative change will overcome problems with prevention. The emerging Welsh homelessness prevention and alleviation duty is seen as a desirable and replicable model of prevention, albeit it offers no panacea to the social tragedy of homelessness. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Homelessness; housing policy; legislation; prevention; rapid-response,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928209204,0

One of the major challenges is the decline in overall homeownership rates with an increasing proportion of households deciding to rent rather than purchase. However, it is surprising that the impact on the housing market following the introduction of a first-time housing subsidy scheme has received relatively little attention. This study addresses this knowledge gap by examining the relationship between (1) housing market intervention based on first-time owner subsidies in a global city and (2) the level of house price volatility in the broader market. For example, the Australian government has implemented different policies designed to ease housing stress among first-time buyers; one high-profile policy was the First-time buyer Grant or First Home Owner Grant (FHOG) in which a cash payment or subsidy is given to new first-time buyers as a direct incentive. Based on a case study approach, an analysis is undertaken of the first-time buyer policy where an innovative approach using the E-GARCH model is employed to assess the effect of the scheme on the housing market. The findings indicated that the FHOG scheme offered a stabilisation effect on the housing market. In addition, there is evidence to support implementation of the FHOG scheme as an effective scheme to enhance housing affordability of first-time buyers. The findings offer a rare insight into the effectiveness of the FHOG scheme in enhancing housing affordability and also maintaining price stabilisation in the broader housing market. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",affordability; First-time owner grant; house prices; housing policy; volatility,affordable housing; homeownership; housing market; housing policy; numerical model; price dynamics; subsidy system; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911987826,0

However, more than 10 years after separation and widowhood, individuals were still significantly more likely to leave ownership than those in their first marriage. Furthermore, late first childbirth and early first-time home ownership were associated with lower chances of leaving home ownership.

The Chinese HPF program constitutes the largest social housing finance program in the world. Yet, very few studies have examined it. This paper documents the history of China's HPF program, in particular, how it has evolved from a local experiment to a prominent national housing program. It then examines the program's management structure and the role of HPF lending in meeting China's housing finance needs. The paper also compares China's HPF experience with the HPF practices in other countries. Finally, the paper examines the challenges China's HPF program faces today and the efforts to address them.

Despite this increase, it is argued that females still lag males in terms of home ownership rates (HORs) with women in Australia facing similar ownership challenges as those experienced in the UK and the USA. In seeking to establish any dynamic change, the study analyses female home ownership rates in Australia for two points in time, 1998 and 2008. Logit models are used to predict HORs. The results indicate that factors such as household type, income and source of income have an impact on rates of ownership.

The variance in housing conditions by social class could provide further insights about the divergence/convergence hypotheses stemming from the comparative analysis of living conditions of European countries. To support this claim, two main dimensions of housing inequality will be identified: tenure and housing well-being. A micro-level data analysis was performed, in order to take account of individual and family costs of access and maintenance of ownership in settings and in periods (such as the present day) of rising housing prices and income resources that decrease in terms of amount and stability. The aim is thus to demonstrate that, despite the difference in well-being in Europe between owners and non-owners (on the average the firsts are better off), homeowners cannot be regarded as a privileged category per se. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",EU-SILC; Housing well-being; Social inequality,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920121893,1

Literature addressing causation is limited, with just 35 relevant studies identified. These were reviewed to build a thematic and contextual account of urban Indigenous homelessness. Eight key themes were evident, which encompass different cultural understandings of housing and mobility, as well as complex and often traumatic relationships between settler states and Indigenous peoples.

The findings of this study indicate that negative social capital significantly predicts areas with higher concentrations of foreclosures (positive relationship) and traditional sales (inverse relationship).

The data are derived from a longitudinal individual-level register-based data-set maintained by Statistics Sweden. The analysis is carried out by way of survival analysis.

Evidence presented in this paper suggests the proposition that public ownership of land, Hong Kong's land leasehold system and the government's fiscal interest in generating maximum revenue from land sales play a pivotal role in explaining gatedness. The big developers prefer and pay premiums for large sites that permit mixed use developments and high site intensity, which by use regulations are required to be gated, while their property management subsidiaries also promote gating because such estates are cheaper and easier to manage. Thus, the extent of gatedness is largely the consequence of Hong Kong's use of land as a resource, its built form, the nature of its real estate and property management industries, and the articulation of these factors. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Gated communities; gating coalition; Hong Kong; housing policy; neighbourhood; urban planning,housing policy; neighborhood; regulatory approach; subsidy system; urban housing; urban planning; China; Hong Kong,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893230108,0

With evidence from the first qualitative study done on families residing in inner-city Helsinki, it demonstrates that urban living reduces the sharp divide between life before having children and family life. Urban parents stay in the city much for the same reasons they first moved there: because they are attracted to population density, good amenities and good public transport. Living in the city enables a lifestyle where different life stages blend into each other. The paper, however, reveals that there is a lack of understanding among city planners and politicians about family needs in the inner city. By adopting a framework of the reviewed literature, the paper draws on the argument that modernist ideals on proper family living still prevail. The paper suggests that planning must acknowledge that exclusionary life stages are eroding and creating a need to facilitate multiple forms of lifestyles. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",family; Housing; housing policy; inner cities; liveability; urban planning,family structure; housing policy; inner city area; lifestyle; population density; urban housing; urban planning; urban population; Finland; Helsinki; Varsinais-Suomi,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906316912,0

Based on the extent of commodification in housing and pensions, we distinguish four types of institutional contexts. We argue that, since relying on housing wealth as a pension essentially boils down to a market-based approach to welfare provision, this strategy is more likely to occur when both housing and pensions are largely commodified, which is only the case in the liberal welfare states.

First, we consider the 'welfare dependency' argument and the claim that 'conditionality' mechanisms will incentivise social renters to (re)engage with the labour market. Second, we interrogate the, arguably more influential, rationale which stresses equity considerations in ensuring that scarce social housing resources are targeted to those in greatest need.

This is evidenced by increasing tenure neutrality of government housing subsidies; equalisation of the secure occupancy rights and minimum standards regulations across most of the rented sector and the recent decline of home ownership and expansion of renting for the first time since records began.

The empirical data are drawn mainly from an analysis of five waves of the census and a survey of 3000 adults across all housing sectors. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.,Hong Kong; neoliberalism; public rental housing; social mix; social theory,housing policy; neoliberalism; rental sector; social housing; social theory; China; Hong Kong,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902845092,1

Accommodating some 17% of households and being an economic driver, its political weight is understandable. But the frailty of the current consensus, based on new production as a solution for solving the ""housing crisis,"" can be approached by analyzing the ruptures which have occurred since the ""glorious times""-in terms of both narratives and actions. Using the image of a ""new deal"" between markets, state, and society and the concept of ""general interest"" as a framework, the paper first discusses the way the post-liberal shift impacts and challenges housing policies and the place of social housing. The historically constructed narrative of the sector is then presented from its origins up to the shift of the 1970s. Finally, it is argued that the turmoil of the last four decades indicates a shift toward a new repartition between the main stakeholders and a different role for the State-that leaves unsolved not only the housing question, but also the social one. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",general interest; market; narratives; social housing; society; State,housing policy; market; social housing; state; France,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902842931,0

Such policies could include minimum density requirements, zoning for multifamily housing, and ordinances enabling the construction of accessory dwelling units. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",hedonic regression; Housing affordability; housing economics; housing prices; land prices; planning; spatial econometrics; urban growth boundary,affordable housing; data set; econometrics; hedonic analysis; housing market; housing policy; land market; regression analysis; urban growth; urban housing; King County [Washington]; United States; Washington [United States],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892676311,1

SOI laws make it illegal for landlords to discriminate against voucher recipients solely on the basis of their having a voucher. The research presented here tested whether SOI laws in the USA improve locational outcomes for voucher recipients. This research found that the impacts of SOI laws on locational outcomes are mixed. We found substantively important reductions in neighborhood poverty rates associated with the implementation of SOI laws and small but statistically significant reductions in minority concentration as well.

In addition, we find that a positive shock to house price growth has a positive and significant effect on consumption, while the negative impact of a house price decrease causes an insignificant reduction in consumption. This suggests that house prices exhibit an asymmetric effect on consumption, with the positive effect following an increase in house prices being dominant in magnitude in comparison to a decline in consumption resulting from a negative shock to house prices. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",consumption; House prices; panel vector autoregressions,consumption behavior; housing market; price dynamics; pricing policy; vector autoregression; South Africa,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887997814,1

It has not therefore been possible to distinguish the effects of each of these changes. The present research, by contrast, studied a fairly small slum clearance scheme on the edge of a major city. Half the families moved no more than one hundred yards to their new homes; the remaining families typically moved between one and four miles.

We examine the relationship between these variables in English neighbourhoods, using occupational mix to measure social mix. We examine the regional differences in this relationship. We show neighbourhoods are generally more mixed in occupation than tenure. Tenure mix has a positive relationship with occupational mix, but the relationship is moderate and contrary to conventional wisdom; occupational mix and tenure mix increase with level of area deprivation.

A post-devolution review of social housing policy in Northern Ireland is followed by a discussion of three key issues from the 2007 to 2011 administration: governance, procurement of new social housing, and 'shared space' and a shared future. Interviews with policy-makers indicate that 2007-2011 marked the beginnings of a trend away from the technocratic domination of officials towards greater intervention and policy ownership by politicians, but that the significance of this should not be overstated.

According to the data, gated communities create tensions in the use of facilities and common spaces, indicating a conflict between ownership of and access to space; the use of housing units, indicating a conflict between openness and privacy; and the use of walls and borders which blur the boundaries between inside and outside realms leading to safety gaps. Finally, the paper argues a processual space leading to conflicts and seeds of change. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",boundaries; Gated communities; Istanbul; ownership and access; space and people; space and safety,accessibility; gated community; homeownership; social change; space use; urban society; Istanbul [Istanbul (PRV)]; Istanbul [Turkey]; Turkey,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84889091883,1

These broad models, however, came under discussion due to the competition policy of the European Commission. Financial government support - state aid - for public or social housing is considered to create false competition with commercial landlords. The countries chose different ways out of this problem. The Netherlands choose to direct state aid to a specified target group and had to introduce income limits for dwellings owned by housing associations. Sweden instead chose to change the law regulating municipal housing companies and demands that these companies should act in a 'businesslike way' and with that aims to create a level playing field.

Tenure is a crucial dimension of the housing market, so it must be central to assessing local housing demands. Despite the wide cleavages between social and private rented sectors, and between both of these sectors and the owner-occupying majority, the geography of tenure-specific HMAs has remained largely unexplored. This paper assesses the importance of tenure-specific HMAs for housing planning within the current policy frameworks aimed at meeting housing needs. The paper then reports analyses to delineate tenure-specific HMAs, with these boundaries then compared with HMAs defined by analysing the whole market. The case for a national system of tenure-specific HMAs based on migration is found to be unproven. Nevertheless, such HMAs can provide the basis for meaningful affordability measures and a tool to address segregation and reshape housing markets in cities. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",commuting; housing market; Migration; planning; tenure,affordable housing; commuting; housing market; housing policy; housing provision; population migration; tenure system; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84889061017,0

Master-planning approaches have largely been used to create prestige estates attracting upper-middle-class residents; however, they are increasingly being adapted for wider markets.

The paper first describes the programs and then explores how leaders, program participants, and neighbors understand the programs' intentions and effects. While family is not prominent in the programs' grant proposals, leaders indicated that promoting traditional families was a central objective. Implementing these programs revealed difficulties in defining family and in managing the programs' outcomes.

Bathore was formed in the early 1990s by poor squatters, mostly from rural northern Albania, a region that became impoverished and lost most services after the fall of communism in 1990. The area that the squatters occupied lacked all infrastructure. However, the squatters built houses that were permanent structures of good quality, often multi-storey. These houses were mostly financed through the remittances of immigrants abroad. In mid-2000s, the Albanian government started taking steps to legalize squatter housing, and, subsequently, to equip the area with infrastructure. Now, Bathore is starting to resemble a middle-class-style suburb, if only in terms of physical appearance.

But they have raised controversy because they impinge on Indigenous aspirations to remain on homeland communities, require mainstreaming of Indigenous housing and transfer Indigenous land to the state. This paper uses recognition theory to argue that if policies of normalization are imposed on remote living Indigenous people in ways that take insufficient account of their cultural realities they may be experienced as a form of misrecognition and have detrimental policy effects. The paper examines the responses of remote living Indigenous people to the National Partnerships at the time of their introduction in 2009-2010. Drawing on interview and administrative data from a national study on Indigenous population mobility, the paper argues although the policies have been welcomed, they have also been a source of anxiety and anger. These feelings are associated with a sense of violated justice arising from experiences of misrecognition. The paper argues this can lead tenants to depart their homes as a culturally sanctioned form of resistance to state control. This population mobility is associated with homelessness because it takes place in the context of housing exclusion. Policy implications include developing new models of intercultural professional practice and employing a capacity-building approach to local Indigenous organisations. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",homelessness; Housing policy; indigenous housing policy; recognition theory; residential mobility; resistance,capacity building; cultural landscape; cultural relations; cultural tradition; homelessness; housing policy; housing provision; indigenous population; policy analysis; policy implementation; residential mobility; social justice; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880944362,0

This paper examines the motivations for owners in mostly middle-ring suburbs of Sydney, Australia, to reinvest through 'knockdown and rebuild' (KDR). This process-not unique to Australia-involves the wholesale demolition of older detached houses and their replacement with completely new dwellings. Until recently, existing literature on housing reinvestment has focused on practices such as renovations or modifications to existing dwellings. Yet, KDR is becoming increasingly popular and moreover appears to involve a distinctive set of actors, drivers and potential impacts. On the basis of a statistical survey of activity followed up by a questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews, the general scale and attributes of KDR are summarised and then explored to discern the main perceived benefits, risks and types of development scenarios pursued. The results reveal a genuine diversity of motivations and circumstances involved in this latest physical makeover of the traditional Australian suburb. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",home ownership; Housing investment; knockdown and rebuild; suburban renewal; Sydney; urban regeneration,homeowner; housing conditions; housing project; questionnaire survey; suburban area; urban housing; urban renewal; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880938577,1

Much new migration has occurred into superdiverse escalator areas already experiencing high levels of deprivation. In the UK, housing market renewal areas (HMRA) had a particular challenge to address housing market failure and the high population turnover often associated with new migration while meeting the needs of established residents. Lack of knowledge about the diverse housing needs of residents risked hampering renewal efforts. This paper uses qualitative data collected from a superdiverse sample of settled and new residents located in the Urban Living HMRA in the West Midlands to examine the ways in which they conceptualise home.

Not many studies have focused on suburban house prices with regard to race, ethnicity, and nativity. This study fills the gap in terms of nativity. This study uses data from the 2000 US Census and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey to perform regression analyses to analyze immigrant gateways as delineated by Singer (2008) with regard to median values of owner-occupied housing units and the factors that influence median values, while also differentiating between inner cities and suburbs.

While this paper highlights the challenges inherent in managing housing issues in Australia during a mining boom, there are likely to be lessons which can be applied in international settings.

We find that results are highly sensitive to the statistical approach employed. Methods controlling for geographic selection bias generally reduce the negative association between low-income neighbours and individual earnings, but substantial differences across models remain. Controlling for both selection and endogeneity produces larger associations and evidence of non-linearity, something that is hidden in models only controlling for selection. All methods suffer shortcomings, so we argue for multi-method investigations to identify robust findings, with instrumental variables and fixed effects on non-mover samples being preferred.

Using medium-sized apartments in Beijing as an example, seven floor plans were developed and a questionnaire survey was conducted where the respondents were asked to decide between different pairs of floor plans based on their own preferences. Based on the data, the spatial properties of the floor plans were examined and sample families were classified by their attributes. Using a modeling approach, the preferences for housing floor plans of various family groups were estimated and discussed in detail. The results demonstrated that 'privacy,' 'south-facing,' 'storage,' and 'number of rooms' were the critical means of evaluation of the floor plans of medium-sized apartments. The preferences of different family groups differed significantly and most families were quite selective regarding floor plans. Thus, high-level customization is necessary in architectural design and information services. The preference indices revealed to what extent people were satisfied with different floor plans and suggested precise ways to improve satisfaction with regard to layout plans. In addition, the results implied that, for apartments smaller than 90 m2, essential functions or 'housing utility' must be given priority.

The terms 'forced relocation' and 'displacement' are often too crude to describe what actually happens within processes of restructuring and the effects upon residents.

Evidence from a recent study of people who have moved out of restructured areas shows that although there is some evidence of physical displacement, there is little evidence of social or psychosocial displacement after relocation. Prior attitudes to moving and aspects of the process of relocation-the degree of choice and distance involved-are important moderators of the outcomes.

Since the 1950s and 1960s, residential relocation has been examined as a matter of social and political debate, especially in gentrification studies focusing mainly on negative residential relocation outcomes long after the process was over. This paper argues that such a focus had led researchers to ignore subtle, practical dimensions of relocation delivery and the causal relationships between these and often very diverse relocation experiences. Based on the HMR case, the study shows that residential relocation in a differentiated polity is delivered by complex networks of actors and that residential relocation outcomes are the result of cooperation or non-cooperation of network members. Key innovation rests in devising a theoretical vehicle that shows how governance has a profound impact on relocation delivery and residential relocation experiences. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",governance; housing demolition; housing market; Residential relocation; UK,demolition; gentrification; governance approach; housing market; neighborhood; relocation; residential location; urban housing; England; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875863133,0

The findings indicate that many youth who were forced to relocate perceive that they moved to better dwellings. However, the improvements were generally small and more than half moved to low-income neighbourhoods similar to those they had left. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",choice-based letting; Displacement; the Netherlands; urban restructuring; Utrecht; youth,demolition; low income housing; neighborhood; urban housing; urban policy; urban renewal; Netherlands; Utrecht [Netherlands],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875856112,0

We argue that a proper and fuller consideration of issues around policy, context, process and outcomes enable researchers and commentators to avoid ready characterisations and self-fulfilling investigations of restructuring which serve to present it as a singular (and somewhat suspicious or conspiratorial) phenomenon. For this purpose, we present a broad conceptual framework for restructuring and relocation studies, based on these four themes. Subsequently, we review major issues in restructuring and gentrification discourses, and briefly reflect upon some of the factors underlying the negative loading of the term displacement. We also identify caveats in the evidence base of relocation studies, both in the United States and in Europe. Finally, we introduce the papers in this special issue. The overall aim of this issue is to offer a more open, balanced starting position for analysis of urban restructuring processes and relocation outcomes, particularly in relation to areas of social housing. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",displacement; gentrification; Neighbourhood restructuring; poverty de-concentration; public housing; relocation,gentrification; neighborhood; poverty; relocation; residential location; social housing; urban housing; urban planning; Europe; United States,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875855566,0

Consistent with previous research, we find that residents moved to somewhat safer neighborhoods with less poverty than those of the public housing. In addition, we find that residents view their new homes and neighborhoods as improvements over public housing. However, subjective pre- to postmove changes in satisfaction are not driven by changes in neighborhood characteristics (i.e., reductions in poverty and crime), but rather by decreases in perceived social disorder and increases in community attachment. Thus, our findings challenge some of the assumptions of poverty deconcentration.

Tracking studies of HOPE VI and similar redevelopment efforts in the US have depicted a record of mixed and inconsistent benefits for the families displaced. Detailed case studies of individual families are used to illustrate the variable and contingent nature of the impacts of displacement and relocation away from public housing. The cases presented here provide examples of how the experience of displaced families can change, sometimes dramatically, over time and how this affects their own assessments of the experience. Residents' perception of relocation is strongly influenced by their overall view of neighborhood restructuring, regardless of whether they themselves directly benefit. The findings suggest that qualitative and or ethnographic research into the experiences of displaced public housing residents can be useful in understanding how relocation affects the lives of very low-income households. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",displacement; housing policy; relocation; Social housing,contingent valuation; housing management; housing policy; low income housing; low income population; neighborhood; perception; redevelopment; relocation; social housing; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875827349,0

Because displaced residents tend to have a low socioeconomic position, they are often confined to the most affordable parts of the housing stock. Since these dwellings are generally concentrated in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods, displaced residents are likely to move to such neighbourhoods. However, they do have a measure of freedom to choose their new neighbourhood. This article reveals which kinds of households move to disadvantaged neighbourhoods and why they do so.

Three broad types of trajectories are defined as an analytical framework for a comprehensive approach of the meaning of relocation and opportunity held by households.

Using policy design theory (Schneider & Ingram 1997), this paper argues that the social constructions of homeownership, low-income households, and the private mortgage industry were instrumental in the development of policies to increase low-income homeownership. The benefits associated with homeownership, based on long-standing norms around success, stability, and the American Dream, justified government interventions to increase access to private mortgage markets for low-income households. This policy stance, however, did nothing to assist households with maintaining homeownership for the long term. The social constructions embedded in the rationales and implementation of these policies contributed to their failure to sustain homeownership and realize its benefits for low-income homeowners. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Homeownership; low-income households; policy design theory; social construction; U.S. housing policy,homeownership; housing policy; low income housing; mortgage lending; social construction; tenure system; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879551789,0

It was found that negative and mixed coverage of the estates dominated, with the amount of positive coverage being very small. By examining the way in which dominant themes were used by newspapers in respect of each estate, questions are raised about the mode of operation of the press and the communities' collective right to challenge this. By identifying the way regeneration stories are covered and the nature of the content of positive stories, lessons are drawn for programmes of area transformation.

Homebuyers earned returns that were competitive with what they would have received if they had invested in stocks or bonds. In addition, homes remained affordable to lower income buyers over time as the homes were resold. Homeownership under these programs was sustainable: there were very low delinquency and foreclosure rates and many families who sold their homes were able to use their sales' proceeds to purchase market-rate homes.

Situated on the edge (or former edge) of many cities, these sites have proven attractive for residential redevelopment. Drawing on two case studies from the UK and New Zealand, we consider the implications of such recycling in the built environment for the memory of the former use, asking how redevelopment addresses the stigmatised past of the asylum. We discuss issues associated with the 're-imagining' of heritage buildings and landscapes and examine the extent to which the past is strategically forgotten or selectively remembered in the repackaging of the asylum as housing.

Nonetheless, evidence suggests that there is a 'common thread' linking these organisations together, namely their core missions and values, which can be classified using the term 'social enterprise'. Despite the growing body of literature on social enterprise, this concept has been poorly defined and applied to the housing sector.

Applying the social movement diagnostic of frame analysis, the paper identifies three 'collective identity frames' that signify the construction of common cause among a diverse and fragmented tenant population. These frames celebrate social housing as a public good, promote grass-roots decision-making and advocate direct democracy to public services. They champion local knowledge and local services and articulate a commitment to collective action and collective provision that opposes itself to the individualising discourse of the market. Although a lack of unity characterises the organisation of social housing tenants, this assemblage of contentious claims may signify the continuation of narratives of a tenants' movement and indicate the cautious mobilisation of a distinctive 'counter-discourse' in housing policy. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",collective action; frame analysis; social housing; social movements; Tenant participation,decision making; housing policy; public goods; public service; social housing; social movement; England; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869175403,0

Around this time, however, lenders began selling homes, especially low-value properties, at a much faster pace, releasing them into local housing markets. This paper examines the sales of foreclosed single-family homes into the Atlanta market from January 2005 through early 2009. A primary goal is to understand the drivers of such sales. A proportional hazards model is used to identify factors affecting the time that homes spend as 'real estate owned' properties, with a special focus on low-value properties. We find that the pace of sales of low-value properties accelerated during 2007 and, especially, in late 2008 and early 2009, and the rate varied based on lender type, neighborhood characteristics, and submarket location.

Poverty and income inequality increase in both 'countries' when equivalent disposable income is corrected for housing expenses. Furthermore, the relative position of outright owners and social tenants regarding poverty improves. Housing subsidies play a (partly) different role in Flanders and the Netherlands. The implicit social rent subsidy in Flanders and the explicit housing allowance in the Netherlands serve the same goal; however, they both redistribute income relatively strongly in favour of low-income tenants.

It focuses on the often ignored private domain of housing, flats and blocks, where changes are also likely to be less visible.

Findings indicate that home improvements have mediating effects upon the psychosocial benefits, which occupants derive from their homes via their impacts upon perceived home quality. However, landlord relations and the quality of the wider neighbourhood within which improvements take place are shown to be important moderators of this relationship.

Many are remaining in the parental home for longer, and even when ready to 'fly the nest' face significant challenges in accessing mortgage finance. This under-30 age group has become 'generation rent'.

These projects, in which housing providers are centrally implicated, aim to provide a form of coercive support to households subject to, or at risk of, legal sanctions. In both core accommodation and outreach models of these projects, the dwelling is a key site, and the inspection of domesticity a primary technique, of governance. This article argues that policy narratives and some academic critiques of these projects are heavily influenced by understandings of governmentality as a disciplinary power based upon Bentham's and Foucault's works on the panopticon.

Against this backdrop, we analyse the sector's recent reconfiguration, integrating the impacts of housing stock transfers and HA mergers. Our analysis focuses on the consequences of sector restructuring in terms of organisational homogenisation and, at least as perceived, the growing dominance of giant landlords. Finally, within the context of the Coalition Government's localism rhetoric, we discuss the accountability implications of restructuring activity and the light our analysis sheds on theoretical understandings of social housing change processes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",credit crisis; housing associations; Housing policy; mergers and consolidation; recession; third sector,credit provision; housing association; housing market; housing policy; merger; modernization; social housing; theoretical study; England; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865817032,0

The evidence for mixed tenure effects in the environmental, safety and economic domains is very mixed. In the human capital domain of health and education, the evidence is sparse.

The paper develops a typology of disabled young people's housing pathways, consisting of direct, staged and return pathways to independent living. Within each of these pathways, young people face key challenges of deciding to leave, finding suitable accommodation and maintaining their accommodation. The research identifies some of the complex interconnected factors that shape the ways young people negotiate these challenges and in doing so key messages emerge for policy makers and practitioners. Moreover, the paper not only informs policy and practice but also responds to questions that have recently been asked of the pathways framework and social constructionism more generally. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",disability; housing policy; pathways; Social theory; young people,disability; empirical analysis; housing policy; social theory; young population,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865809532,0

Specifically, it is a strategy for managing the aural and material excesses of family life; it mediates familial relations and supports the production of middle-class identities.

Studies on transitional societies have demonstrated how politicized the housing market can become and how housing consumption is determined by both economic forces and public rules. Rural housing in China offers a unique institutional environment. While residential land is collectively owned and allocated, villagers have the freedom to make decisions with regard to construction space. Drawing on a large national survey, this paper provides the first systematic analysis of the consequences of these different institutional rules. In terms of housing resources, residential land is distributed in a relatively equitable fashion, but the building of structures on that land is defined by a higher degree of social stratification. These findings extend the current literature and confirm the power of institutional rules in housing consumption. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",China; communal allocation; Housing consumption; residential land,affordable housing; housing market; rural area; social housing; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864582301,0

Using information from a survey of low- income working households (LIWH) and in-depth interviews with LIWH families, it addresses two policy-relevant questions. First, there are mixed findings on whether the current HB system enables HB recipients to consume more housing than is available to otherwise similar non-HB-recipient households in the PRS. HB rules on eligible property size appear not to unduly favour HB claimants compared with LIWH. LIWH, however, tend to pay a rent which is less than the maximum amount an HB recipient could receive.

However, the emergence of new, capitalist forms of housing after 1990 started to endanger the position of large housing estates on the local housing market. The question was repeatedly raised in the literature about whether large housing estates of post-socialist cities would experience physical decay and social downgrading similar to the West. This paper investigates the socio-economic differentiation of large housing estates in the former state-socialist countries using a case study approach. Housing satisfaction and mobility of residents in four post-socialist housing estates were analysed through a standardised household survey. Empirical data confirm that despite their similar physical appearance, the attitude of people towards large housing estates and their position on the local housing market vary significantly. The authors conclude that even though socialist large housing estates are affected by social downgrading, nevertheless they represent relative social stability and can offer affordable housing to people who are at the start of their housing career. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",comparative housing research; large housing estates; Post-socialist cities; residential mobility; social differentiation,affordable housing; differentiation; housing market; housing project; residential development; residential mobility; social housing; socioeconomic status,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860304030,0

Controlling for housing and socio-economic characteristics, the study finds differences in the extensive margin in withdrawing equity, but not in the intensive margin. That is, while Non-Hispanic black homeowners are less likely to extract home equity in general than non-Hispanic whites there is no difference in the amount of equity withdrawn. However, much of this difference is driven by their lower propensity to withdraw equity using a home equity line of credit; non-Hispanic black and Hispanic homeowners are just as likely to withdraw equity using a cash-out refinance than non-Hispanic white homeowners. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Homeownership; housing finance,black population; credit provision; ethnicity; homeownership; housing finance; Latino people; lending behavior; mortgage lending; race; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860285943,1

Community perspectives on this issue reveal that 'official' priorities are often not considered to reflect the true nature of local need. There is considerable appetite for setting 'community priority' and for assuming direct responsibility for housing delivery. Discussions with community groups in different parts of rural England are used to expose these concerns, which accord with the UK government's localism agenda, a component of which is the empowerment of parish councils to deliver additional homes for 'local need', above planned allocations. However, although community perspectives may become vital in driving future policy outcomes, there are associated risks. These perspectives may belong to a dominant minority, with a tendency to draw narrow definitions of localness and local interest as a means of closing the door to unwanted development. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Housing need; housing policy; rural housing,community response; empowerment; housing association; housing management; housing policy; England; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860278162,0

This paper extends current knowledge by exploring how- and indeed, if-child support money is a useful resource in meeting the housing needs of the children of separated parents. The study reports on the findings arising out of in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 33 parents who received child support money. The impact of child support is often limited by three factors: the amounts paid, the circumstances of its payment (and in particular, unreliable payments), and the values guiding its allocation. The paper argues that ultimately, the benefits of child support are constrained because it is a privatised response to gendered, structural inequalities in housing, care and income following separation and divorce. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Child support; children; divorce; housing choice,child care; child welfare; divorce; housing; income; legislation; poverty; social policy; socioeconomic conditions,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859584710,0

It looks for insights within their 'hybrid' status, spanning state and market, and subject to multiple sets of institutional conditions. Four frames of hybrid identity are developed, and then substantiated via a discussion of two different sectors of not-for-profit social entrepreneurs in Australia and the Netherlands. As the growth trajectory of each sector is traced and the construction of hybrid identity is explored from both public and private perspectives, institutional pressures are revealed that set the current context for development.

Indeed, informed by the proposition that home and housing should not be conflated, the social, psychological and emotional elements of home have been well documented. Home is thought to be subjectively experienced. As such, some have shown that people defined as homeless may not actually feel homeless, but rather experience their accommodation or situation as home. This paper is based on ethnographic research with a group of people sleeping rough in Brisbane, Australia. It argues that their problematic experiences residing in public places, together with their biographies of feeling disconnected from society, underpinned their ideas of home. For people in this study, housing and home were synonymous. The physical structure of a house was important to assume control over their day-to-day lives. Home, however, stood for something beyond housing. Home was constructed as a signifier of normality, and as a commitment to participation in Australian society. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",homelessness; rough sleeping; The meaning of home,homelessness; housing; psychology; research; sleep; Australia; Brisbane; Queensland,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859572082,0

It looks at ideas from a retrospective approach, but also analyzes the future directions of research and theory in the area demonstrating how the study of housing can contribute to wider debates in the social sciences. The book comes with a comprehensive introductory chapter and individual chapter introductions. It is divided into four parts: Markets; approaches; context; and policy. With an international team of contributors, the Handbook is a stimulating, wide-ranging read that will be a useful source and reference for academics and researchers in geography, urban studies, sociology, social policy, economics, and political science. © 2012 SAGE Publications Inc.

This paper reviews recent international work applying concepts of social enterprise and hybridity to illuminate organisational behaviour. It addresses critiques of the explanatory value of these concepts by exploring their underlying meanings and their application to diverse case studies worldwide. The concepts are found to be most useful where they inform dynamic analysis of hybridisation and identify underlying change mechanisms, rather than simply providing static descriptions of hybridity. Analysis can be enriched by drawing on institutional theory to develop concepts such as competing organisational logics, trade-offs between social and commercial goals and resource transfers. The paper looks at policy as a driver for hybridisation and to the regulatory challenges for policy systems that have come to rely on hybrid forms of delivery. A research agenda is proposed building on these conceptual frameworks to develop systematic approaches to data collection and analysis to enable clearer and more consistent meanings to emerge. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",Hybridity; Social enterprise; Social housing,,Editorial,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868103890,1

Interest is focused on the consequences of neighbourhood effects. The paper uses the 1999 Population Census for Paris and the three surrounding sub-regional administrative districts in order to estimate different models that take into account the potential endogeneity bias of the residential location choice. The study first runs a bivariate probit model that includes the residential location as an endogenous variable.

In this paper, the theory of social constructivism, including Kemeny's advanced application of this theory to the field of housing studies, is used to (a) explain the causes for a particular type of property restitution in the Czech Republic and (b) outline its consequences on the role and long-term social meaning of private rental housing. This research explains how restitution was viewed by the main participants in this discourse, and how the whole process was legitimised and socially constructed in the Czech Republic. The evidence presented stems from a multi-method analysis of discourse that integrates the results of in-depth interviews, content analysis of the press, and an analysis of data from attitude surveys. The paper shows how the initial state of consensus surrounding the image of restitution quickly dissolved. The emergence of divisions combined with the inadequate response of the state generated a biased image of private rental housing among Czech citizens-a pattern that persists to the present. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",housing market; housing privatisation; private rental housing; property restitution; social constructivism; Transition,housing market; privatization; rental sector; social construction; Czech Republic,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858328619,1

It adopts the monetised concepts of 'net housing income' and 'net housing resources', which are commensurable with disposable income and income-based measures of poverty. It was found that both housing systems exert a poverty-reducing impact compared to disposable income alone. The absolute reduction is greatest in England, suggesting that its housing system counters the high levels of income poverty produced by the welfare system, although the comparative levels of poverty between the two countries remain unchanged, which may signify that the distribution of disposable income is replicated in housing. However, the synthetic concept of 'housing poverty' reveals that the poverty-reducing impact of housing income/ resources arises because by themselves they are distributed far less equally than is disposable income, so creating a much higher rate of 'housing poverty'. Crucially, 'housing poverty' occurs predominantly among those who are not income poor. This allows welfare and housing systems to combine to reduce poverty in an act of progressive dissonance, suggesting a hitherto unexpectedly high degree of independence between the two. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",comparative housing; housing economics; Welfare state,housing; income; poverty; welfare provision; England; Netherlands; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858317732,0

The housing sector is important for monetary policy and financial stability, highly interconnected with the financial system, and dependent on institutional details that vary widely across countries and through time. Easier and cheaper access to finance does not improve long-run housing affordability; but if credit conditions ease too much and the credit assessment process breaks down, strategic default becomes more likely. That defaults rose so far in the US shows how unusual its housing system is-a fact not revealed in simple aggregate statistics.

As a result, there has been inadequate attention paid to the impact of increased real household incomes and wealth on the structural sustainability of a housing system built on homeownership as the dominant tenure. This paper argues that, where housing supply is relatively inelastic in the long run, underlying demand pressures may keep house prices on a path which continues to diverge from household incomes. This will add to borrowing constraints already faced by aspiring first homeowners with low and moderate incomes and with limited wealth. If financial institutions tighten lending standards in response to the GFC, households with limited equity and limited capacity to pay will find it even more difficult to gain access to finance than has been the case in the past. This raises the question of whether homeownership can be sustained at its current levels. The paper uses outcomes in Australia to illustrate the points made and suggests that other countries, such as the UK, may well be about to follow the same path. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Homeownership; housing finance; housing market; housing system; sustainability,financial crisis; homeownership; household income; housing finance; housing market; sustainability; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858309979,0

Since this time however, approaches have diverged. In the UK, housing assistance and the land use planning system have co-evolved, with planning an important tool for securing affordable housing, particularly in England.

Following the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), housing was recast in the public and political consciousness and received substantial policy attention. In this era of rapidly declining housing affordability as well as threats to the supply of housing finance, the Australian Government renewed its approach to housing assistance. The paper examines housing assistance in Australia and assesses individual outcomes in terms of a 'wellbeing dividend'. It draws upon on a survey of 1700 low-income households to examine individual outcomes for health and wellbeing across three of Australia's major forms of housing assistance.

One factor that is widely recognised as adding to the complexity is the fragmentation of landownership. However, not only does this affect the process, it also reveals itself in the outcome of urban regeneration-the urban morphology. Property rights theory helps to conceptualise this relationship. On the basis of this and two empirical cases, this paper demonstrates that the assignment of bundles of property rights over land, the delineation of the right use land and the value of land are intimately linked. These links affect the urban morphology both directly and indirectly. A direct effect of property rights structures is the incorporation of existing land uses in new development schemes. Indirect effects are the physical measures, such as increased densities and less public space, which are taken to compensate for the financial deficits that are caused by high land acquisition costs. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Housing supply; Institutional economics; Land policy; Planning; Property rights; Urban regeneration,landownership; property rights; public space; urban housing; urban morphology; urban planning; urban policy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960317323,0

Therefore, an important question is how a housing association should allocate its resources in order to achieve its goals. Traditionally, housing associations set financial targets and discuss social aspects, but they fail to set concrete targets for their social objectives which can be measured and evaluated properly. The problem is that social objectives are often difficult to quantify and compare. This paper introduces a method that makes it possible to compare social objectives and to actively involve social objectives in the decision-making process of housing associations. In this way, the decision-making process becomes more transparent and housing associations can optimise their social performance given the available capital. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Housing associations; Resource allocation; Social performance; Transparency; Weighing objectives,comparative study; decision making; housing association; methodology; optimization; performance assessment; planning method; resource allocation; social behavior,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960316142,0

In the context of sociodemographic variations of American homeowners, this study extends previous research by examining the differential effects of parental ownership of a single-family home. The current study employs the Panel Studies of Income Dynamics data, using propensity score matching to address self-selection problems. The results suggest that the intergenerational effect of parental housing tenure has been differentiated by race, income and the housing tenure history of parents while reinforcing inequality. Even within the same housing tenure, offspring of socio-economically disadvantaged groups are less likely to take advantage of parental homeownership in attaining a single-family owner-occupied home. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Causal inference; Homeownership; Housing tenure; Inequality; Intergenerational effects,homeowner; homeownership; income; race; tenure relations,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960313964,1

This is in contrast to dominant approaches (in the US and Europe) that assert the need for successful progress towards treatment goals (usually whilst living in temporary congregate accommodation) prior to resettlement. Evaluations of Housing First indicate, however, that even those considered farthest from being housed can, with help, successfully maintain a mainstream tenancy of their own. It is asserted here that one locally based agency managing both the housing and assertively providing holistic non time-limited support packages may be important factors in the success rate of Housing First programmes.

The notion of liminality is used as a framework to help understand the views of residents, highlighting the diversity of their experiences. Both park home residents and residential boaters ascribed a range of positive qualities to the environments in which they lived, underscored by the perception that the spaces that such accommodation occupied were often associated with leisure.

It is concluded that satisfaction with the dwelling is higher for the elderly and residents with higher incomes, and in situations where the dwelling has been renovated and is sufficiently large. The presence of children and a longer duration of stay have negative impacts, and renters are generally more negative than owners. Estate satisfaction is highest among immigrant households or when the dwelling is renovated, and among lower educated inhabitants.

It identifies the effect of the risk of expected prepayment by using a unique dataset of Dutch borrowers insured against default. It is argued that expected prepayment is mainly caused by expected residential mobility of the borrower, which might be due to a change of the value of the collateral or because of a change of income of the borrower. The estimates indicate that lenders require a higher mark-up on the lending rate from households with a lower liquidity constraint, while the collateral constraint has a very limited influence on the mark-up. Thus, it appears that lenders take into account of the possibility that future income shocks may improve the relative position of households in the housing market. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Collateral constraint; Lending rate; Liquidity constraint; Mortgage market; Prepayment; Residential mobility,housing market; income; lending behavior; mortgage lending; residential mobility,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956322321,1

The use of these concepts is illustrated for Flanders and the Netherlands. They show that each concept has its own uses and that they are not interchangeable. However, both concepts indicate that in 2005 higher-income households, and especially homeowners (with a mortgage), were relatively better off than lower-income households, particularly renters.

First, the reasons for actual moves are explored, initially with regard to the age and education characteristics of the households. Further consideration is given to the type of previous dwelling, duration of residence in the previous dwelling and the distance from the origin to destination areas. The results related to age are consistent with previous studies; older households are less mobile. However, duration of time in the residence reflects a different pattern from previous studies; in Istanbul, it appears not to reduce residential mobility. Second, planned mobility is analyzed according to household structure such as age, education, tenure and income. The analysis is expanded by adding dwelling characteristics and 'roomstress'-a measure of the space needed by the household. Further, neighbourhood characteristics are added to elaborate their impact on the probability of the residential mobility. Results reflect that renters are more mobile than owners. While high accessibility decreases the odds of residential mobility, neighbourhood traffic problems positively increase the odds of future mobility. However, 'roomstress' appears not to provide a significant source of explanation in any of the models. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Actual moves; Istanbul; Planned moves; Residential mobility,household structure; metropolitan area; neighborhood; rental sector; residential mobility; urban housing; Istanbul [Istanbul (PRV)]; Istanbul [Turkey]; Turkey,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956293110,1

Four methodological challenges are highlighted that are directly related to mobility: (1) measures of exposure time; (2) neighbourhood change; (3) selection bias; and (4) endogeneity. These are all topics worthy of scholarly interest in themselves, but also challenges that all neighbourhood effect studies must address to convincingly argue that their results are indicative of causal relationships-results of neighbourhood transmission mechanisms-and not just statistical correlations.

It outlines the nationalist and agrarian drivers which expanded the initial role of social housing beyond the goal of improving housing conditions for the poor towards the goal of extending homeownership, and assesses whether this focus made it more similar to the 'asset based welfare' approach to housing found in South-East Asia than to social housing in Western Europe. From the mid-1980s, the role of Irish social housing changed as the sector contracted and evolved towards the model of welfare housing now found in many other Western countries. Policy makers have struggled to address the implications of this transition and vestiges of social housing's traditional function are still evident, consequently the boundaries between social housing, private renting and homeownership in Ireland have grown increasingly nebulous. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Homeownership; Ireland; Social housing,homeownership; housing conditions; housing project; housing provision; rent seeking; social housing; welfare provision; Ireland,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952983873,0

This paper argues that second home ownership in Chinese cities is not only a result of an increasingly mature housing market but, more importantly, an unintended consequence of socialist housing policies and institutions, such as the subsidized sale of public rental housing and associated partial property rights, the continued provision of subsidized housing by work units, the continuing household registration system and the lack of property tax. Using the 2005 China General Social Survey, this paper empirically studies the patterns and dynamics of second home ownership in urban China. While households' socio-economic status contributes to conventional second home ownership, the persisting socialist housing policies and institutions have led to the unique phenomena of owing one home with partial property rights and owning a second home, and renting the primary home even in the public sector and owning a second home. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",China; Homeownership; Housing; Second home,housing association; housing market; housing policy; rental sector; second home; socialism; socioeconomic status; urban housing; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952982178,0

The study finds that people with a strong intention to move are almost four times as likely to move as people with a less strong intention to move. Homeowners are more likely to realise a strong intention to move than renters who want to move within the rental sector of the housing market.

To encourage BTS, the government has introduced a fast-track planning approval process, a waiver of a deposit for a developer's license and an exemption for low-cost houses. However, many developers are reluctant to implement BTS. This study aims to identify factors that influence housing developers' readiness to implement BTS. Readiness theory has been used to construct a housing developer BTS readiness model. A questionnaire-based survey was carried out with developers in the major cities of Malaysia. Statistical analyses such as descriptive analysis and multiple regression analysis were used to analyse the data. The findings here revealed that external support and market readiness are the two most important factors influencing Malaysian developers' readiness to implement BTS. This implies that reassessing government incentives, educating home buyers about BTS and improving the role of finance institutions will help to facilitate the implementation of BTS in Malaysia. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Housing delivery system; Housing developers' readiness; Innovation,housing management; housing project; housing provision; innovation; social housing; technology adoption; Malaysia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952975856,1

Responsibility for funding social housing was separated from the regulatory role, after more than 30 years during which they had been combined within the Housing Corporation. The changes were intended to introduce and promote a new culture, on the one hand encouraging wider involvement of private, profit-seeking organisations in the production and management of social housing. On the other hand, the expressed intention was to develop a more consumer oriented approach to the regulation of social housing.

The paper investigates whether DIY activities were prevalent near the 'Old Town' where officials encouraged renovation. It was found that overall, DIY activities were prevalent among households in 2001-2002 regardless of socio-economic status. However, residents of particular housing types were not more likely to engage in DIY activities nor was DIY activity associated with condition of buildings and open spaces between buildings. Nonetheless, perceptions of neighborhood quality were important in explaining DIY activity. The findings also show that DIY activity was no greater in/near the gentrifying city center than elsewhere.

As city centres intensify, more families are moving into inner-city apartments. In a study carried out in response to this change, in-depth interviews with parents living in Auckland's CBD found that key drivers were affordability, less reliance on cars and the convenience of the central location. Drawbacks included poor quality apartment design and lack of play space for children, both inside apartment complexes and outdoors. Fears about children's safety were strong.

First, the salience of securitisation framing theory is reviewed as a critical analytical lens that might have utility within the urban housing context. Second, key national housing narratives are identified and discussed in relation to the role of regulation at the risk management/securitisation nexus. Third, the national securitisation of Australian housing as part of the broader political economic 'great risk shift' is discussed.

The extent of the changing climatic conditions, in combination with growing urbanisation, is making both Southern and Northern institutions and associated social security and governance systems increasingly inadequate in dealing with extreme weather events. This results in an urgent need to discover innovative ways to adapt 'outdated' institutional responses and to increase local-level engagement. This paper analyses current risk financing mechanisms at local and institutional levels in both a Southern and a Northern city (San Salvador and Manchester respectively).

Therefore, this study attempts to justify this administration-driven marking scheme. It appears that welfare conditionality cannot fully justify the scheme because public housing tenants are not the only recipients of housing welfare in Hong Kong. In addition, discriminating between public housing tenants and the most deprived is not defensible. More importantly, not all the offences prescribed in the marking scheme are socially undesirable. However, the substance of the scheme seems to match the ideologies of Chinese legalism quite well, and the scheme appears to be an initiative by the Hong Kong Housing Authority to strengthen its sovereignty over public housing resources in the city. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Anti-social behaviour; Chinese legalism; Policy opportunism; Social housing; Welfare conditionality,antisocial behavior; housing policy; ideology; social housing; sovereignty; welfare provision; China; Hong Kong,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960307632,0

Understanding the relationship of social housing systems to the wider housing market remains a key challenge. The mobility of households and the structural configuration of supply are both of importance, demanding methods able to reconcile both. This paper propounds vacancy chain models as offering significant potential in this regard, allowing policy analysis and options appraisal to be built on more dynamic conceptualisations of housing systems. The theoretical basis for vacancy chain models is developed before an account is given of a model developed of the Bradford (UK) social rented sector. The results suggest that social renting is very closely linked to the wider housing market and consequently the impacts of policy and investment may be felt beyond the sector.

Of the six UK reviews of primary studies, most drew on less than half the available primary studies, none provided a critical appraisal of individual studies and made no comment on conflicting evidence between and within studies.

Since the 1990s, however, a more insecure economy combined with the reorientation of housing and social policies has led to divergence in people's housing pathways. The conservative nature of public policy has largely been maintained, advantaging middle-class family households in accessing homeownership. However, in response to economic stagnation and within the context of pervasive neo-liberalism, the government has moved sharply towards accentuating the role of the market in providing housing and mortgages. Neo-liberal policies have become more pronounced while conservative institutions have firmly been ingrained in Japan's post-war society. Conventional middle-class families, protected by conservative policies in moving up the housing ladder, have maintained their relatively advantageous positions in the market economy. Neo-liberal policy has especially affected the housing conditions of specific groups who have been beyond the protection of conservative institutions, i.e. unmarried individuals, low-income households and those in unstable employment. The combination of conservative and neo-liberal approaches in policy practices has thus had strong diverging effects on people's housing opportunities.

The nationwide Housing Provident Fund is still of minor importance. The majority of homebuyers continue to rely heavily on personal savings and parental contributions to finance home purchase. Mortgages are gaining importance, with slightly less than one-third of the purchases employing this means. Demographic attributes have relatively minor effects on mortgage loan utilisation. Socio-economic status is of somewhat greater significance; however, it exhibits contrasting effects in Guangzhou and Shanghai, which may be attributed to the difference in local housing market conditions. Migrants are discriminated by their hukou status. The findings show hukou status affects access to mortgage primarily through its impacts on the job market. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",China; Housing finance; HPF; Mortgage loan,comparative study; credit provision; homeownership; housing finance; housing market; housing provision; local economy; mortgage lending; socioeconomic status; urban area; urban housing; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Shanghai,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958554443,1

The expenditure-to-income ratios calculated for households confirm that the average cost of housing rose for tenants and homeowners, as well as for most income groups generally. This contribution analyses the development of various components of household expenditure which contributed to these higher ratios. One of the most important considerations here is the fact that average household disposable incomes either fell (tenants) or remained stable (homeowners) during the four-year period under review. This leads to the question of whether these increasing income differences between renting and owning can be attributed to the business cycle alone, or whether they are part of a longer-term trend that will eventually result in a rental sector that provides housing for those on lower incomes. The findings suggest that a longer-term or structural widening of the income gap between renting and owning may indeed be taking place. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Affordability; Expenditure-to-income ratio; Income inequality; The Netherlands,affordable housing; homeowner; homeownership; household expenditure; income distribution; rental sector; tenure system; wage gap; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958545405,0

Pooled cross-sectional regression and discrete-time logistic models are used to estimate the hazards of 'sitting purchase' and 'moving purchase'. Both models illustrate different time patterns of sitting purchase and moving purchase. Sitting purchase is particularly conducive to long-term occupants with seniority in work units, which alters the relationship between housing tenure and life cycles. People with better education are more likely to become homeowners via sitting purchase, but the spouses' effects differ sharply concerning political capital: only the husband's party membership has a significant positive effect. In addition to party membership, job rank and work unit also play an important role in facilitating the family's sitting purchase, suggesting that redistributive powers and organizational links contribute to the competing sources of housing inequality in a market-oriented economy. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Beijing; China; Homeownership; Housing policy; Housing tenure; Moving purchase; Sitting purchase,affordable housing; family structure; homeowner; homeownership; household income; housing market; housing provision; housing reform; tenure system; Beijing [China]; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958537426,1

However, within this segment the analysis is not conclusive with respect to differences in rental fees. Furthermore, in Oslo the tenancy conditions of social assistance recipients differ somewhat from the general rental market in that short-term contracts are used more often while this is not the case in Trondheim.

However, with the rise of owner-occupancy, this association has not been so straightforward. An alternative view is to view housing policies that promote owner-occupancy for households to acquire assets, as an attempt by the state to reform social welfare systems. The politics of welfare reform are related to the discourses of homeownership ideology. The ownership of (housing) assets agenda serves as a means to change the relationship between state, market and individual households. This view is mostly based on the British experience and this paper seeks to broaden it by examining the Netherlands and Spain. The paper shows differences, but also that housing policies play an important role in driving towards or maintaining market-dominated solutions. Housing is used to either reorient towards or maintain a welfare system where asset ownership and market dependency is deemed more appropriate than secure income and public expenditure. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Asset-based welfare state; Comparative housing; Homeownership; Housing policy; Spain; The Netherlands,capitalism; homeownership; housing market; housing policy; social change; state role; tenure system; welfare economics; welfare provision; welfare reform; Netherlands; Spain; United Kingdom; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954984415,0

The implementation of the Housing Market Renewal programme has stimulated a debate about the extent to which the public sector interventions are leading to the gentrification of poor neighbourhoods. The paper finds that there is no evidence of gentrification in older neighbourhoods, however, inflows of capital rather than middle-class residents have altered the physical development of the city to an extent that the housing choices of all income groups have been affected.

Although urban villages are well known for their disorder and unruliness, they provide temporary livelihood for indigenous villagers and inexpensive shelter for migrants and other urban residents. Urban villages are typically perceived as homogeneous low-income neighbour- hoods characterized by low quality and high density housing. In fact, housing differentiation has emerged in urban villages among residents who possess different quantities and types of capital, rights/entitlements, skills and other assets. This paper aims to understand the social groups and the housing differentiation among them in the Chinese urban villages from an institutional perspective. It is based on a large-scale household survey in 11 urban villages in six Chinese cities. Empirical data show evidence of significant housing differentiation within these enclaves: indigenous villagers have become a petty rentier class; rural migrants pay the highest rents while enduring the lowest housing conditions; and housing conditions for urban hukou holders lie between those of the other two groups. Regression analysis suggests that urban villages share similar dynamics of housing differentiation as wider urban spaces, i.e. the combination of strong institutional constraints and emerging market influences leads to housing differentiation and inequality.

Data come from the ITAGEN2, a statistically representative survey of students aged 11-14, living in 44 Italian provinces during the 2005-2006 school year (10 537 Italians and 6368 immigrants). Parents of Italian children are often able to combine three housing objectives: homeownership, spaciousness and proximity to relatives. The considerable rise in the price of real estate over the last decade has meant that many immigrant families have been drawn into a vicious cycle: the increasing lack of financial means has made purchasing a large home impossible for many, forcing families to rent or buy a little house far from their close relatives. This distancing in turn affects their economic situation, in that the possibility of receiving informal aid (i.e. childcare, etc.) is reduced. A lack of suitable housing policies exacerbates the difficulty of breaking this pattern. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Homeownership; Housing tenure; Immigrant assimilation; Migration; Proximity to relatives; Spaciousness,child; homeownership; housing conditions; housing market; housing policy; housing provision; immigrant; migrants experience; rent seeking; Italy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952663871,1

Single women are less likely to be homeowners than single men. Moreover, the earning potential has a greater effect on homeownership for single men than for single women.

It is argued that redefinition of the proper performance of motherhood by the privileged constitutes an important aspect of cultural change, making positive evaluations of motherhood more difficult to achieve without a proper house. This results in an increase in stage fright, or women avoiding motherhood because they feel ill prepared to perform it properly, and an increase in the devaluing of certain categories of mother.

Another explanation could be that for different reasons immigrants choose to settle in so-called ethnic enclaves where they can find an ethnic social network, which can support them in their new country.

In the event of old-age dependency, housing assets become a key self-insurance device. However, little empirical evidence has been reported regarding an individual's expectations of having to use their housing wealth for such a purpose.

The paper's findings suggest that homeowners' WTS in old age is unaffected by their income or housing assets and is, rather, determined by socio-environmental housing characteristics and the individual's health and personal needs.

The structure of UK house prices has been impacted markedly by the Labour Government's efforts to ingrain a particular notion of financial literacy amid the move towards an increasingly asset-based system of welfare. New model welfare recipients and new model homeowners have thereby been co-constituted in a manner consistent with a new UK growth regime of 'house price Keynesianism'. However, the investor subjects who drive such growth are necessarily rendered uncertain compared with the idealised image of government policy because of their reliance on the credit-creating decisions of private financial institutions. The recent steep decline in UK house prices is explained here as an epiphenomenon of the disruptive effect on the idealised image caused by the dependence of investor subjects on pricing dynamics not of their making. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Asset-based welfare; House price Keynesianism; Investor subjects; New Labour; UK house price collapse,conceptual framework; economic structure; governance approach; homeowner; homeownership; housing market; investment; Keynesian theory; price dynamics; welfare economics; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951787987,0

In this context, this paper explores shifting trajectories of homeownership using three specific housing debates: 'the emergence of a gap society', 'increasing single-person households' and 'housing assets in later life'. By exploring these various debates, it attempts to highlight how housing, demography and social policy interact at different levels and in different areas to produce dynamic shifts away from the conventional post-war housing trajectory. Current trends have exhibited shifts away from: the linear upward housing trajectory; the family-centred housing model; the land-orientated housing system; and homeownership dominance per se. The concept of generation is used as a thread to tie the different debates together. Each housing issue is often more relevant to a particular generation, but relationships between generations within families and society add to the dynamism to the current shifts. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Generation; Homeownership; Housing trajectories; Japan; Social policy,demography; homeownership; housing; social policy; Japan,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951776211,0

As a consequence, two competing historical models have existed: first, a model promoted by the socialist pillar based on social rental housing in urban settings; second, the model put forward by the hegemonic Catholic party, emphasising the promotion of homeownership of single-family dwellings in rural settings. When this second, anti-urban model, became the main housing model for the masses in the post-war period, its spatial layout was one of sprawl and disinvestment in urban neighbourhoods. However, from the 1970s onwards, various actors have contested this policy. In response, policy makers have turned to a discourse of inner-city social mix. However, this discourse was barely translated into practice and did not affect the hegemonic model. Following Gramsci, this paper analyses how social mix has primarily served as an instrument for passive revolution, by deviating and disempowering counter-hegemonic attacks on the leading model of suburban homeownership. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Flanders; Gramsci; Housing policy; Neighbourhoods; Social mix; Urban regeneration,economic regeneration; hegemony; housing policy; inner city area; neighborhood; renewal policy; urban housing; urban planning; urban policy; Belgium; Flanders,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951129826,0

HOPE VI, the main US initiative in this area, is aimed at the large-scale demolition of public housing projects and their replacement by smaller-scale, mixed-income developments. The logic model behind the effort to redevelop public housing and disperse subsidized housing residents anticipates benefits at both the individual and community level. Individuals are expected to progress in a range of economic, social and physical ways when freed of the negative area effects associated with high levels of income and racial segregation. Communities are expected to become more livable when rid of dysfunctional and outmoded public housing estates and their discouraging influence on private investment patterns. This paper examines the strengths and weaknesses of this model, assessing, in the process, the potential for achieving the policy goals set out by those advocating dispersal. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Housing dispersal; Social housing; Urban regeneration,housing policy; housing project; investment; neighborhood; racial segregation; social housing; subsidy system; urban area; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951085352,0

The demolition of the social-rented sector is a crucial element of area-based restructuring policy in the Netherlands. As a consequence, many residents, most of whom have a low income, are forced to move to another dwelling. By means of an analysis of the dispersal pattern of displaced households in the Dutch cities of The Hague, Utrecht and Leiden, this paper gives insight into the effect of urban restructuring on segregation. The main conclusion is that displaced households do not concentrate in a small number of neighbourhoods, but follow a dispersed pattern. However, displacees seem to have a tendency to move to neighbourhoods with a high percentage of non-Western minorities and a large proportion of social-rented dwellings. This tendency indicates that concentrations might become apparent in neighbourhoods that match these characteristics. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Dispersal; Displacement; Segregation; Urban restructuring,demolition; household structure; minority group; neighborhood; racial segregation; social segregation; urban area; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951083112,0

Three more specific anti-segregation policies are also identified and analysed: housing and social mix policy (first initiated in the 1970s); the refugee dispersal policy (initiated in the 1980s); and the area-based urban policy (initiated in the 1990s). Of these three, the last two have a clear ethnic focus while mix policies primarily aim for socio-economic and demographic mix. The analysis shows that none of the policies have managed to affect levels of segregation more than marginally, the reasons being ineffective implementation (the mix policy), failures in the design (the refugee dispersal policy) or conflicting aims inherent in the policy (area-based interventions). © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Desegregation policies; Housing mix; Neighbourhoods; Planning; Sweden; Welfare state,housing policy; implementation process; neighborhood; planning method; social segregation; urban policy; welfare reform; Sweden,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951078545,0

This paper takes an historical perspective, tracing shifting emphases of political discourses and policy approaches to minority ethnic residential segregation and inclusion, and setting these alongside broader understandings of governmental social control. The paper reflects on episodes of post-1945 intervention into settlement patterns and housing circumstances, and highlights key problematic experiences associated with certain kinds of 'top-down' interventions going beyond ethnicity. It is concluded that neither demolitions nor dispersal are very likely to generate social integration, unless they reflect and reinforce positive adaptation strategies that minority ethnic households already tend to pursue. The keys to constructive social development lie primarily outside the realms of housing renewal and governmental strategies for social engineering. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Ethnic integration; Housing policy; Neighbourhoods; Renewal; Social control; Urban regeneration,demolition; ethnic group; housing policy; inner city area; minority group; neighborhood; political discourse; regeneration; settlement pattern; social development; social inclusion; social segregation; urban area; urban renewal; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951074176,0

Using estimates from a housing tenure choice model, this paper conducts micro-simulation analyses to assess how this change could affect young adult homeownership transitions. The simulations reveal that increased student debt levels and the new repayment profile and their interaction with lender-imposed borrowing restrictions delay a first-time homeownership transition. The extent of the delay primarily depends upon the expected earnings profile, but lender criteria and general rises/falls in real house prices are also important. The analysis suggests that there will be much greater variation in the timing of house purchase between different groups of future graduates, brought about by increased graduate earnings heterogeneity, homeownership affordability schemes targeted toward specific types of households, and parental financial assistance. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Credit market constraints; Expected earnings profile; Homeownership; Household formation and tenure choice; Housing economics; Housing policy; Student debt,debt; homeownership; housing policy; student; young population; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77449155312,1

During this period of transition, rents have remained relatively low in the remaining public housing, and purchase prices offered to occupants of public housing have been well below market prices. Although these rents and prices are partly based on known formulas, there is considerable variability in how much people pay for similar apartments. This study uses 2000 Census data to estimate the housing subsidy received by the remaining renters in the public sector and purchasers of public housing, based on private sector prices for housing of comparable quality and size. The paper also analyzes variation in the estimated discount from market prices that these people receive. The findings show that the biggest winners in China's transition from socialist housing allocation are those who were favored in the previous system, based on such factors as residence status, education and occupation. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",China; Comparative housing; Housing privatization; Housing tenure,housing market; housing reform; privatization; subsidy system; urban housing; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77449090771,1

Specifically, the study adds to earlier studies of homeownership by adding spatial impacts. It advocates simultaneous adjustment for intra-municipal correlation and heterogeneity as well as spatial spillover patterns between municipalities. It concludes that ignorance of controlling for intra-municipal correlation, heterogeneity and spatial spillover skews conclusions regarding effects of the determinants of homeownership. Furthermore, it finds that endogenous as well as exogenous spatial spillovers are essential parts of specifying demand for homeownership. Specifically, the demand for homeowner- ship spills over and stimulates demand in neighbouring municipalities, and house prices and incomes exert positive effects on demand for homeownership in neighbouring municipalities.

The integrated analysis of ALPR and SLPR housing focuses on inalienability restrictions to ownership entitlement. By preserving current property use, inalienability can address externality, public good and even macro-economic problems that arise from property sales. Both ALPR and SLPR provide good empirical support for the theoretical hypotheses. Moreover, they demonstrate some important functions of inalienability in a transitional economy, including helping to maintain macro stability as well as being an important tool for implementing partial reform strategy. Inalienability is also a second-best tool to protect private property rights against the intervention of local political forces. However, various problems with ALPR and SLPR housing show that inalienability is also a rough tool that needs to be improved or replaced in order to achieve micro-economic efficiency. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",Homeownership; Housing affordability; Housing tenure; Inalienability; Property rights; Rural land,affordable housing; homeownership; housing market; macroeconomics; microeconomics; policy reform; property rights; tenure system; theoretical study; transitional economy; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350366077,0

While there have been a number of attempts to estimate the responsiveness of UK supply, relatively little has been written on what determines it. A key omission is the effect of long-term real interest rates. Steep falls in both the annual rent to house price ratio and long real interest rates during a period of relatively static real rents in the UK suggest that the stream of future imputed rents became discounted at successively lower interest rates between 1996 and 2007. New supply responded sluggishly to price rises during this period, but then collapsed rapidly as the market turned in 2008. This paper argues that the decline in long-term real interest rates contributed to rising house prices and the inelastic supply response during the long upswing, and that cyclical asymmetries inherent in the supply response have been exacerbated by changes in the financial system and increased government regulation of the planning process. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",Housing economics; Housing market; Housing supply; Price elasticity of supply; Real interest rates,estimation method; financial system; housing market; interest rate; price determination; price dynamics; rental sector; theoretical study; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350364768,1

Widows need to overcome their fear of living alone and to master household work that their husbands had previously undertaken.

Widowers characterize their houses as cold places and use terms such as 'cavern' and 'cave' to describe how they feel.

This paper, drawing upon in-depth interviews with residents of the Manor estate in Sheffield, discusses the strength of housing-based explanations of worklessness. It finds that residents have responded to economic transformation by drawing on locally concentrated social networks and are unwilling to sever these close ties in order to access jobs that are frequently experienced as exploitative and demeaning. Consequently, their inertia can be viewed as a rational response to the low paid, chronically insecure jobs available in the post-industrial labour market. The author concludes that the significance of housing-based explanations of labour immobility is that they are simultaneously congruent with welfare reform that uses a compulsive strategy to enforce work habits and provide ammunition for those antagonistic to the principle of social housing. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",Discrimination; Job-related immobility; Social housing; Social tenants; Welfare state; Worklessness,accessibility; commuting; housing market; journey to work; labor market; residential location; social housing; social network; travel behavior; welfare reform; England; Eurasia; Europe; Sheffield [England]; United Kingdom; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350350580,0

Currently, it is unknown whether social capital contributes to residential stability and reduces residents' propensity to move. In this paper, social capital levels of stayers, movers and newcomers are studied in two recently restructured neighbourhoods in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Using survey data, social capital is operationalised as benefits of everyday cursory interactions, trust, shared norms and collective action. Logistic regression analysis shows that age, length of residency, employment, income, dwelling satisfaction, dwelling type and perceived neighbourhood quality significantly predict residents' propensity to move. Newcomers are more inclined to move again than stayers and other movers. Social capital is of less importance than suggested by previous research; housing features, satisfaction and neighbourhood perception affect residents' propensity to move much more strongly.

It explores the impacts of a 'territorial injustice' of service provision for poor neighbourhoods, arguing that insufficient service provision operates as a 'neighbourhood effect' compounding the problems of being poor and living in a poor area. The paper shows how high levels of social need and a failure within environmental service provision to compensate for these levels of need combine and interact to deepen the environmental problems encountered in many deprived neighbourhoods. In particular, the paper shows how these interactions reduce the capacity of both front line service providers and neighbourhood residents to cope with environmental challenges and thus reveals processes which entrench neighbourhood disadvantage. In so doing, the paper contributes to debates about how so-called 'neighbourhood effects' occur. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",Housing and environment; Neighbourhood effects; Public services,environmental issue; housing conditions; neighborhood; public service; service provision; urban morphology; urban service,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449433596,0

Most of the earlier accounts were based on simplified versions of the structure-agency dualism or one or other variant of rational choice theory. Responding to criticisms that these relied too heavily on overly static notions of 'choice' and 'constraint', a few then turned to a form of theorisation that deployed a modified version of Giddens' structuration theory. This paper seeks to take the debate further by developing a model that retains much of the essence of structuration yet embodies a more dynamic and theoretically nuanced interpretation of both structure and agency. Structure, normally seen predominantly as a form of social regulation, will be seen as multi-layered and multi-dimensional and also, importantly, as subject to often unpredictable exogenous factors. The concept of social agency will also be subjected to a radical re-conceptualisation that reflects, amongst other things, recent shifts in social capital theory interpreted in the light of rapid demographic change (influenced by geo-political factors), ongoing social inequality, racism, and heightened inter- and intra-communal tensions in some areas. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",'Race'; Discrimination; Ethnicity; Faith; Housing market; Residential mobility,conceptual framework; ethnicity; housing conditions; housing market; modeling; race; residential mobility; settlement pattern; theoretical study; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449360438,0

Whether to upgrade incrementally across many settlements or upgrade fully one settlement at a time? Whether to offer residents more than one upgrade alternative?

Second, homeowners in Germany did not benefit from the same high subsidies as in countries such as Spain or the Netherlands. Third, the German rental housing market was not rendered inoperative by excessive interventions in rents, as was the case in countries such as Spain and the UK.

In part, this is due to the failure of public housing programmes, dwindling state resources, unimpressive performance of state-owned enterprises, and recognition that the government alone is unable to solve the housing problem. On a broader scale, the changes are rooted in liberalization ideologies that have swept through most economies in the 1980s and 1990s, which have had varying effects on people's housing need and on the national economy.

This led to a strong response from the domestic commercial banks that actively entered the mortgage market for the first time. These changes led to a substantial decline in long-term real mortgage rates, increased the access to credit, and allowed homeowners for the first time to withdraw equity from their homes without actual transactions. This paper sets up a simple model of housing demand and supply to analyse these effects. The results suggest that the structural changes led to a substantial rise in housing demand, with house prices rising by 25 per cent one year after the shock. This triggered a similar rise in housing investment approximately two years after the shock. The model predicts that the effects on house prices gradually die out as house prices return to the level that is consistent with normal profit margins in the construction sector.

But for areas that are already close to the threshold, regeneration can be successful. Therefore, identifying the thresholds is important. Testing for thresholds is not straightforward, but the paper provides empirical evidence. The implications for policies concerned with social mixing are not encouraging.

They have also coincided with the highest rates of growth of the global economy on record. The downturn of house prices in the US that began in late 2006 has been the trigger for the US sub-prime crisis, itself the catalyst for the broad financial crisis that began in August 2007 which by September 2008 had become the worst US financial crisis since 1929. As a result, the structure of the highly influential US mortgage finance system has already changed fundamentally. These US problems will lead to a thorough review of mortgage securitization processes and of the wholesale funding of mortgage finance across the world. However, housing markets and housing finance systems differ significantly between countries and will channel the shocks originating from the US with varying intensity. Given the interdependence of the global economy, the quality of the US policy response and its impact on the depth and duration of the US recession will influence house price downturns in all other countries. This paper, written in the midst of the US crisis, looks to our understanding of fundamental economic and financial relationships: first, to describe the key features of the house price boom; second, to examine the likely impacts of the unwinding of that boom; and, finally, to bring out implications for affordability, the provision of housing credit and the most appropriate forms of tenure for higher risk households.",Affordability; Global credit boom; Housing price; Volatility,commodity price; financial crisis; global economy; housing market; mortgage lending; North America; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58849150260,0

Many households move house when circumstances change, and it is often at this point that they also make their tenure choice. This paper employs a bivariate probit framework to model the transition rate from renting into homeownership. Using a sample of initial renters, subsequent tenure choice is analysed jointly with the stay-move decision. A particularly important question in this context is whether low-income households face differential constraints on entering owner occupation that could be addressed by policy change. The empirical model includes financial characteristics, household characteristics and changes in household characteristics as explanatory variables. Changes in household composition are particularly important in explaining variations in both tenure choice and mobility. Hence, the common practice of estimating housing market behaviour using a panel of intact households potentially obfuscates important determinants of that behaviour. The paper proceeds by using the equivalent of a Chow test to show that a hypothesis of equal coefficients in samples of low- and high-income households is firmly rejected. Thus low-income households do behave differently. Short-term variations in income appear to have little effect on people's capacity to enter owner occupation. However, low-income households are more dependent on past savings for successful entry. This suggests a rather different policy approach if owner occupation is to be expanded.",Bivariate probit; Homeownership; Low-income; Tenure transition,decision analysis; homeownership; household income; low income population; numerical model; tenure system; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58849137610,1

The paper departs from this focus on the collective endeavours of housing management as a profession to examine how housing managers themselves create and present self-identities.

Given that social housing in England is essentially a residual mode of provision, it is argued that a more flexible approach in balancing these two conflicting principles in rent setting is needed.",Affordability; Financial viability; Harmonisation; Rent differential; Residential mobility; Social housing,affordable housing; housing association; housing market; housing policy; residential mobility; social housing; England; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49549087468,1

Both the function and meaning of technical artefacts are mainly socially constructed. Usually the function of a technical artefact is taken to determine its use, but in particular in housing a close interrelation between use and meaning is also observed. The use and the meaning, as intended by technicians and architects, may differ from the use and the meaning of housing, as managed and used in the real world. In exceptional, mostly dramatic, cases the housing function of housing estates may finish within 10-20 years after completion. This paper presents the horrific case of Cite de la Muette (not far from Paris), a public housing project which may be understood as a form of a changing social shaping of technology during which the physical construction involved remained essentially the same. There was a huge gap between the modern ambitions of the architects and the engineers, and the difficult-to-let situation of the housing estate after completion. The use and meaning of the estate changed in a dramatic way when the housing function of the estate was replaced by another function, namely that of a transit camp for the deportation of Jews.

Problems and drivers are reconceptualised within an holistic, comparative framework. It is demonstrated that low levels of ethnic spatial segregation conceal a real problem of social residential marginalisation. This paradox predominantly originates from macro-scale mechanisms of differentiation rooted in the welfare redistributive arrangements and dualist housing systems.

This interest is also inspired by debates on gentrification and displacement. The prevailing idea is that the lowest income groups particularly suffer from displacement in terms of their housing quality and increased rents. In addition, increasing proportions of forced movers are assumed to harm the housing opportunities of other house seekers, while competing within the social rented sector. Although several studies deal with the consequences of forced relocation, a broader perspective on housing chances is currently lacking. Moreover, most studies are qualitative, whereas a larger-scale quantitative analysis is needed to test assumptions mentioned above. This paper addresses these matters by analysing housing allocation data of the Haaglanden in the Netherlands and two cross-sectional surveys among forced movers in the region's central city, The Hague. Findings indicate that housing chances for both forced and regular house seekers have not declined substantially since 2000. Moreover, most forced movers experienced dwelling progress, partly thanks to the design of the housing allocation model. However, low-educated, as well as middle- and higher-income households less often report dwelling progress.

The paper argues that the notion of power as embedded in structuration theory is important to the understanding of the process and outcome of tenant participation. The case study shows that it is difficult to fulfil the high ambition of co-operating in equality when positions are structurally different, even when the actors have formally agreed to do so. In crucial issues, the actors' own motives prevail and the distribution of power is decisive. In the studied case, tenants' successes were achieved only on less controversial issues. Nevertheless, formalised participation provides an added value to the outcome for all actors, including the weaker ones.

In the residential mobility literature considerable attention has been given to examining issues of house prices, life-course and demographic influences on the decision to buy, but less attention has been directed to understanding the internal family decision-making process. While the act of purchasing a property constitutes a significant economic event for a family, the process of purchasing a house is an inherently social activity, involving setting goals, discussing and negotiating family needs, interacting with exchange professionals (information intermediaries), imagining modifications to potential purchases and interpreting market trends. These family activities are shaped by family structures, gender roles, ethnicity and socio-economic status. In addition, the house purchase process takes place within specific market conditions and institutional practices. For example, in New Zealand, the estate agent has a large amount of power when negotiating contracts between buyers and sellers. Using in-depth interviews, this paper examines family decision processes in Auckland from the perspective of estate agents who deal with families purchasing houses on a daily basis, and formulate their own understanding of buyer behaviour, and adult family members who have recently purchased houses. The analysis makes it possible to explore the ways in which estate agents interpret the purchasing behaviour of families and to compare these interpretations with the understandings of adult family members. The study offers insights into the ways in which families engage in search practices, interpret information and internally negotiate decisions. It is argued that the findings here contribute a greater understanding of how housing markets are performed and made.",Emotions; Estate agents; Family decision-making; House purchase; Power relations,consumption behavior; cultural economy; decision making; family structure; housing market; power relations; Auckland; Australasia; New Zealand; North Island,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41149178226,0

Contrasts are made based on the empirical case of Japan, drawing explicitly from qualitative interviews with Japanese homeowners. A specific feature across societies where homeownership dominates in policy and housing demand appears to be the persistence of a set of economic values associated with owner occupation despite market volatility and substantial differences in socio-economic conditions. However, the paper also considers difference in meaningful dimensions of owner occupation, with divergent manifestations of investment, asset and use values in housing consumption.

The housing economics literature is more methodologically diverse than many housing analysts might expect and, in the UK and Europe in particular, this has helped stimulate several new developments in local market analysis. These advancements have been associated, in part, with improvements in statistical techniques and conceptual models. This has resulted in renewed interest in the treatment of neighbourhood segmentation and complex spatial processes in local market analysis.

Comparing Britain with the USA, the paper draws on biographies and resource inventories for a sample of 100 working families from five high-cost cities (London, Edinburgh, San Francisco, Seattle and Portland). Micro-market practices from this sample are presented in the form of vignettes to highlight the complex ways that housing consumption (such as use of a spare room) intersect with financial assets of the home (equity withdrawn to spend on family care). While some of these reported practices could be adopted by tenants as well as owner occupiers, the suggestion is that buying a first home and climbing the housing ladder (however risky in terms of mortgage finance) now assumes the imperative of future welfare provision. By exposing the multiple ways in which households 'spend' their housing assets on needs as well as wants, this paper points to the hidden costs for individual households (in time, money, discomfort, anxiety and ill-health) of a housing-led privatisation of welfare.",Debt; Equity; Household assets; Housing consumption; Post-welfare,comparative study; consumption behavior; debt; equity; housing market; welfare provision; Eurasia; Europe; North America; United Kingdom; United States; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41149135762,0

However, the fact that during such 'bubbles' the spatial pattern of house prices, which can mainly be attributed to accessibility differences, usually remains unchanged, suggests that the irrational forces that are presumably responsible for unexplained movements in house prices obey some regularities: they seem to affect the level of house prices, but not their spatial pattern. This suggests that it is worthwhile to consider the explanatory power of psychological variables like those reflecting general (nation-wide) feelings of optimism or pessimism. This paper considers the development of Dutch house prices in the years 1999 and 2000, when house prices increased fast. Existing explanations of the long-run development of Dutch house prices on the basis of economic fundamentals (notably income and the mortgage interest rate) would suggest a much more modest development of house prices over these years. The paper also shows that commonly used housing market indicators, notably the number of vacancies (houses for sale) and the time on the market, are unable to explain the development of house prices during this period. However, the paper finds a strong relationship between the development of house prices and the Dutch index of consumer confidence.",Bubbles; Consumer confidence; House prices,commodity price; consumption behavior; housing market; price dynamics; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41149133475,1

It is argued that price is an affective as well as an economic affair, whose volatility is more an expression of sociality and emotional intelligence than an exercise in irrational exuberance.",Agencement; Cultural economy; Housing markets; Price,commodity price; consumption behavior; cultural economy; housing market,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41149098207,0

The proportion of properties in need of rehabilitation increased substantially in the post-1989 period, representing a different type of risk for tax-credit projects.

It reveals that although the traditional drivers of demand for this benefit - rising unemployment and lone-parent families - have become less significant in recent years, they have been replaced by a new driver, rising immigration.

The paper then examines two different perspectives, variously giving explanatory weight to economic and cultural factors. The first, derived from the work of Michael Harloe, provides an explanation of the tendency of social housing to move towards a residual role, but has nothing to say about the growing significance of housing markets and housing wealth in relation to the contemporary welfare state. The second, originated by Jim Kemeny, is based on international correlations of homeownership rates and levels of welfare state expenditure. It is argued that this approach has limited, and diminishing, relevance in the context of the early 21st century. The paper suggests that in the present period housing, especially the housing wealth of owner occupiers, provides governments with the opportunity to pursue welfare restructuring.

It is observed that the new reform measures have been successful in reviving the housing market by attracting private and foreign investment and producing housing for the middle- and upper-income population, but have led to the loss of safety nets, and ignored the informal urban context of the city, resulting in the exclusion of about a third of the city population who live in slums and bustees. As a result, the benefits of housing market growth have been offset by the failure to meet the broader social agenda.

Limited knowledge of the private rental support programs stands in stark contrast to the detailed research on programs established to address homelessness and problems within the public housing sector. This paper addresses this lacuna by reporting on the suite of initiatives currently funded by state governments to assist low-income households (for example, bond loans and rental deposits, advice and help with removal expenses). Based on a comprehensive study of Private Rental Support Programs (PRSPs) commissioned by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, it is argued that though policies to assist vulnerable tenants are acknowledged as a success by practitioners and clients, their effectiveness as a policy instrument is undermined by wider structural changes in the housing market.

Second, the 'yo-yo' effect, whereby women move in and out of negative situations in an ongoing cycle, is common. Third, it is argued that transitions are only successful if individuals find identity and 'ontological security'. Housing is a crucial aspect in these transitions; however, it can have negative as well as positive effects. It is argued that there is strong evidence to suggest that the conditional welfare services given through the entanglement of the welfare and criminal justice systems play a pivotal role in maintaining marginal lifestyles and a cycle of entrapment into social exclusion. These wider issues of the marginalisation of women who are assumed to be 'deviant' and 'disordered' are connected to broader changes in the West that criminalise and oppress citizens who are outside of mainstream society.",Homelessness; Prostitution; Transitions,crime; homelessness; housing provision; legislation; marginalization; prostitution; service provision; social exclusion; welfare provision; womens status,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-35348843372,1

During this period official policy has favoured an increasingly assertive approach in this area as exemplified by the successful post-1998 programmes to reduce street homelessness. The period since 2002 has seen a broader ministerial drive to reduce homelessness, mainly through encouraging local authorities (LAs) to adopt more pro-active, preventative approaches to the problem. Aided by substantial central funding LAs have responded by developing numerous initiatives to this end. Particularly where they involve assisting people at risk of homelessness to access private tenancies, such schemes are often justified by LAs as empowering consumers and promoting choice. With official homelessness figures in England having fallen dramatically since 2003/04, it would appear that the new 'homelessness prevention regime' has made a marked impact. However, what such figures do not reveal is the extent to which this results from the adoption of more restrictive interpretations of LA duties under the homelessness legislation.

This feature is seen as critical in the reinforcement of disadvantage, its transmission between generations, and as a barrier to social integration. Government policies in the UK have increasingly targeted improved school standards and performance, while other policies on urban regeneration and housing may interact with this issue. This paper examines the particular role of homeownership tenure alongside the other factors (notably poverty) which affect school attainment. After reviewing existing literature it presents new analyses of attainment based on linked pupil, school and small area-level datasets for selected areas in both England and Scotland. This provides some evidence to support the contention that homeownership has an additional effect on school attainment, beyond that explained by poverty and other associated variables, although there is some uncertainty about how separable these effects are at school or neighbourhood levels.

This study offers advances in both areas. First, it treats the key explanatory variables above as endogenously determined (sometimes simultaneously so). Second, to deal both with this endogeneity and the selection problem, instrumental variable estimates are computed for how childhood average values of neighborhood poverty rate relate to fertility, education and labor market outcomes in later life. The paper analyzes data from the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) that are matched with Census tract data, thereby permitting documentation of a wide range of family background and contextual characteristics. For children born between 1968 and 1974, data are analyzed on their first 18 years and various outcomes in 1999 when they are between 25 and 31 years of age. The application of instrumental variables substantially attenuates the apparent neighborhood effects. Nevertheless, support is found for the proposition that cumulative neighborhood poverty effects averaged over childhood have an independent, non-trivial causal effect on high school attainment and earnings.",Childhood; Earnings; Educational attainment; Family background; Home ownership; Neighbourhood effects; PSID; Socio economic success; Young adult outcomes,educational attainment; fertility; homeownership; income; neighborhood; poverty; socioeconomic conditions; urban society; North America; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548361592,1

The theoretical approach is based in a multi-level model combining census data, such as percentage of social assistance and migration rate, further social collective efficacy and intergenerational closure at the meso level, and several variables at the micro level, such as perceived deviant behaviour, disorder and willingness-to-move out. Decomposing the total area into six neighbourhoods, considerable variation is found in the extent of social mix between these areas. Further, heterogeneity varies by indicator of social mix. Due to this heterogeneity, effects on dependent variables differ significantly. Further, neighbourhood exhibits different means on all variables but comparatively similar values of heterogeneity. Since multi-level analyses could not be applied due to the small number of neighbourhoods, correspondence analysis is suggested as a method to specify and visualize the relations between the variables of different levels. Correspondence analysis reveals the six neighbourhoods to have different levels of norms and different correlations with the explanatory variables, such as transfer income. Two major conclusions emerge from the analyses. First, seemingly homogeneous deprived areas are internally heterogeneous, which may account for the inconsistent findings on social mix on behavioural outcomes. Second, studies and policies of social mix should give more attention to the problem of dimensions (and their combination) of social mix.",Distressed area; Internal heterogenity; Perceived deviance,correspondence analysis; heterogeneity; perception; urban area; Central Europe; Cologne; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; North Rhine-Westphalia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548308922,1

The paper examines whether ethnic concentration in neighbourhoods influences indicators of socio-cultural integration, i.e. inter-ethnic contacts, language proficiency and mutual stereotypical attitudes. The analyses show that social contacts between majority and minority groups are less frequent in ethnically concentrated neighbourhoods. However, a degree of mixing has a positive influence on the actual orientation of the indigenous Dutch towards ethnic minorities. The analyses also reveal that in neighbourhoods experiencing a sudden influx of non-Western citizens, inter-ethnic attitudes tend to be more negative.

The survey focused on the push/pull factors leading to their decision to live in the suburbs, their housing search strategies, and their use of services in Mississauga and in the initial area of Portuguese immigrant settlement in downtown Toronto. This study uses data from a questionnaire administered to 110 Portuguese homebuyers in 1990, shortly after their first move to suburban Mississauga; a sample of those respondents were re-interviewed in 2003. The evidence indicates that these immigrants were 'pulled' into relocating to Mississauga because of their desire to live in a single-family dwelling in a good neighbourhood. Their housing search relied extensively on ethnic sources of information, particularly Portuguese real estate agents. In general, this group of immigrants expressed satisfaction with their move. The Portuguese community in Mississauga is characterized by a form of voluntary segregation, which seems to be partly a result of their reliance on their own ethnic community for information, language barriers to participating in non-Portuguese activities, and a cultural preference for living near people of the same ethnic background. One consequence of this re-segregation process, by which Portuguese people recreate a Portuguese 'homeland' in the suburbs, has been the limitation of their social contacts with members of other ethnic communities that have also settled in suburban Mississauga.",Enclaves; Housing; Portuguese; Suburbanization,ethnic group; European immigrant; immigrant population; suburbanization; urban housing; Canada; Mississauga; North America; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34447312451,1

This approach has been articulated via the political process as well as through a media 'conversation' that form a milieu within which defensive homeownership has emerged. It is suggested that a threshold has been crossed marking a transformative moment in which left-leaning calls for understanding have been supplanted by a call for the increasingly vicious defence of home territories. In a broader context of neo-liberalism the transition toward increased privatism, freedom of choice and unfettered agency now closely correspond to the position of homeowners as 'consumer sovereigns'. Defensive homeownership therefore appears not only as the aspiration of homeowners for safety but also as a result of a complex interrelationship between political, media and ideological systems that have generated strong impressions of risk and victimisation. The paper documents the powerful socio-legal and political discourses which have reinforced territorial instincts while generating a broader culture of fear played out through celebrated cases in the public domain. In conclusion, it is argued that defensive homeownership expresses an aggressive aspect of the socio-political constitution of that tenure and a broader need for the deployment of cathartic public policies in defence of embattled home territories.",Ethal defence; Homeownership; Neoliberalism; Revenge/revanchism; Socio-legal,homeowner; homeownership; neoliberalism; strategic approach,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34447311637,0

While recognising the strengths and importance of this evidence base, this paper identifies a fundamental gap in current understanding of minority ethnic housing situations and experiences; the failure of analysis to acknowledge and understand the extent to which situations and experiences vary between places. Few studies have been sensitive to the particulars of minority ethnic housing experiences in different locations and those that have tend to have focused on the same small number of major towns and cities. Small town and rural experiences have remained largely invisible, despite increasing numbers of minority ethnic households living beyond the multi-ethnic metropolis. This paper recognises and responds to this situation by venturing beyond the current evidence base to explore the neglected housing experiences of minority ethnic people in small town England. Two key points are asserted. First, that minority ethnic people living in small towns encounter many of the same housing inequalities as their counterparts in metropolitan England. Second, that small town England presents a series of unique challenges demanding distinct responses and resulting in experiences very different to those recognised within the existing evidence base.",Housing; Minority ethnic; Rural; Small towns,ethnic minority; metropolitan area; racism; small town; urban housing; England; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34447307908,0

However, while governments develop policies aimed at spatial mixing of various population categories, the actual knowledge about ethnic concentrations and their development is rather thin. This paper intends to contribute to filling this gap in knowledge about ethnic concentrations and related dynamics using very detailed spatial data on settlement patterns in the city of Amsterdam. It focuses on residential concentrations of Moroccans and Turks and analysed the changes with regard to these concentrations between 1994 and 2004. In general no indications were found that one of these groups is consciously strengthening the ethnic identity of the residential areas they live in. Although the existing Moroccan clusters did appear to have become somewhat more Moroccan, the Moroccans themselves experienced a negative migration balance in those areas. Turkish clusters became even less Turkish and there was also a negative migration balance among Turks. Furthermore, concentrations within the 1994 boundaries were, in 2004, less Moroccan and Turkish than would be expected, given the developments that took place in Amsterdam as a whole. Detailed analysis of the clusters demonstrated no clear systematic increase or expansion of existing clusters. Analyses of associations with housing supply support the assertion that the residential dynamics of immigrants must be seen primarily as resulting from a number of steps in the residential career. Residential behaviour that has been described for the immigrant categories in question can be assumed to reflect a development toward integration.",Housing mix; Integration; Segregation,cultural identity; ethnic minority; ethnicity; immigrant; settlement pattern; social segregation; urban housing; Amsterdam; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; North Holland; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247893777,1

However, according to Putnam's definition of social capital, not only social networks, but also norms and trust give people the tools they need for participation. Other authors concentrate on the relationship between neighbourhood attachment and participation. However, an empirical analysis in which both factors are combined is lacking. This paper describes the combined effect of social capital together with neighbourhood attachment in explaining participation. The findings show that participation is greater for residents with social networks in the neighbourhood, who reject deviant behaviour, and have a stronger neighbourhood attachment. Trust in authorities was not found to have any statistically significant impact on participation. The conclusions underline the theoretical assumption that social capital and neighbourhood attachment form a useful pair of concepts in explaining participation, because they focus not only on what people have, but also on their mindsets.",Governance; Neighbourhood attachment; Neighbourhood restructuring; Participation; Social capital; Social mix,governance approach; neighborhood; quality of life; social capital; social network; social participation; urban area; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; South Holland; The Hague; Utrecht; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247872857,0

The progressive reorganisation of urban space, which is at least partly a result of global economic changes, is producing complex forms of social politics organised around newly emerging varieties and scales of engagement and disengagement. These are cross-cut by a number of cultural themes that play out differently in different spaces. Thus 'fear' is universally significant, but perceived 'differentially' according to space, culture and socio-economic status. 'Excitement' is also an important theme, though more for some groups than others. The capacity to use resources - material, cultural, technological - and particularly the reflexive utilisation of these resources, also affects the nature of social politics and the specific nature of proactive and defensive (dis)engagement.

There does appear to be a problem of inadequate and unresponsive housing supply in England, by international or historical standards. Although shortcomings of the house building industry and limited public investment play a part, the most important factor explaining England's housing supply problem is the operation of the land-use planning system. Policies, procedures and incentives are all implicated. The most important impact is a long-term real rise in the price of housing, differentiated by region, which is damaging both economically and socially, although there are some compensating benefits in terms of the environment. The Barker Inquiry has proposed a radical supply agenda, which has been substantially accepted by the present government. This proposes that planning targets should be geared to affordability, with more land released and market-contingent mechanisms, more social housing and supporting infrastructure investment. There is room for debate about the magnitudes involved, the role for more proactive approaches to development and the best fiscal mechanisms and incentives. However, given the fraught political economy of housing and planning in the pressured regions, there is considerable doubt as to whether these measures will be implemented on the requisite scale.",Affordability; Housing supply; Land-use planning,affordable housing; housing policy; housing provision; land use planning; England; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33947185287,0

The major objectives of this restructuring included bringing public expenditure under control, ensuring that a high proportion of housing costs were paid by the direct beneficiaries and targeting available subsidy more directly on those in housing need. This agenda was supported by more general policies of liberalisation and privatisation, and particularly by the growth in asset values during the 1970s and 1980s and by macro-economic stabilisation during the 1990s.

This paper examines the role that mortgage market deregulation has played in extending access to homeownership. It also examines its social and economic impacts. Deregulation is characterised as an unfolding process, rather than an explicit policy with identifiable objectives. It is identified as involving the ending of direct controls over building society lending, the opening up of the mortgage market to competition as a consequence of the abolition of exchange controls and the 'corset', the creation of a level playing field between banks and building societies, and a shift towards regulatory convergence between banks and building societies. Institutional, social and economic consequences of deregulation are identified. Deregulation led to a much more competitive mortgage market, facilitated the shift of the bulk of mortgages from the mutual to banking sectors and contributed towards the polarisation of the industry between specialist providers of savings and mortgage products and diversified financial institutions. Deregulation widened access to homeownership by widening access to housing finance, but also introduced more risk into the system. However, the risk-choice trade-off has been tilted in the direction of risk by the inefficiency of the supply-side. This has caused many of the benefits of deregulation to be lost in higher house prices. Deregulation also altered the relationship between the housing sector and the economy by making housing wealth more liquid, and this has had important implications for economic management. The pricing out of many people from owner occupation and the importance attached to spreading housing wealth are driving the design of current policies designed to increase homeownership further still.",Deregulation; Housing finance; Mortgage market,deregulation; homeownership; housing finance; housing policy; mortgage lending,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33947106999,0

It is based on an analysis of policy trends over the past 30 years, and a critical examination of current policy dilemmas. The central contention is that there are fundamental tensions underlying the present government's policy objectives to maintain the 'safety net' role of social housing but at the same time widen access to the sector so that it becomes a more mixed 'tenure of choice'. The paper charts the marked change of direction seen since 2000, with a switch from a highly rule-bound approach emphasising equity in housing allocations, to a more consumerist system stressing choice. Survey data and statistical returns are analysed to illustrate the changing mix of households entering social rented housing and to reveal the sector's varying role in regions characterised by contrasting housing market conditions. The paper charts the spread of the 'choice-based lettings' approach and discusses the possible implications of this development for the pattern of rehousing outcomes, and for the sector's broader role.

Public proclamations about homeownership are frequent from these officials and echo many of the claims made by federal policy makers. While the federal government has promoted and funded policy to increase homeownership for decades, little is known about the level of financial support devoted to homeownership at the local level or the reasons for any variation in support among cities. This research examines the attitudes of city mayors about local policies and homeownership and investigates explanations for support of homeownership policy. In doing so, the research uses a public choice framework to explore the effects of inter-city competition and other factors on local housing policy making. Using data from surveys of city mayors and professional staff, as well as US Census data, this research finds that high levels of competition are associated with higher levels of support for homeownership. Furthermore, the results suggest that homeownership programs may be considered developmental policy in cities, not redistributive policy like most housing programs. The paper concludes with theoretical and policy implications based on the research results as well as identifying needs for future research on local homeownership policy.",Cities; Homeownership; Housing policies; Tenure,homeownership; housing finance; housing policy; policy making; political economy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845952817,1

In this paper an atypical category, middle-class families living in the city, is addressed. The aim is to understand why these households disconnect the seemingly natural relationship between families and the suburbs. Empirical evidence comes from interviews with families living in two Rotterdam neighbourhoods. Three interrelated sets of explanations were found. First, families express clearly the time-geographical reasons for urban living. In particular, the location of work provides a strong incentive to seek housing in the same city. Second, social embeddedness is a strong reason for staying. Understanding housing preferences requires the conceptualization of families as social networks. Third, these families define themselves as true urbanites and sturdy families who reject the suburbs as a suitable place in which to live.

This paper argues that land and development right ownerships enable the Hong Kong Government to operate a massive public housing program to meet the housing needs of half the population at affordable rent and price levels, without having to resort to planning tools. However, the availability of subsidized housing still depends on other factors, notably government commitment and priority in solving housing problems. Landownership is less useful in regulating private housing prices as political and economic factors often override the situation. The empirical findings of this study suggest that land supply was often adjusted in response to the economic environment rather than shaping market outcomes. Hence, government ownership of land and development rights is found to be more effective in providing affordable subsidized housing to low-income families through the producer-subsidy approach rather than in regulating housing prices to enhance the affordability for private housing consumers.",Housing affordability; Land policy; Planning policy; Regulatory intervention,affordable housing; housing policy; housing project; landownership; low income housing; planning system; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Hong Kong,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845918952,0

Indeed, Ireland's house building rate, which is among the highest in the EU, has probably helped to curtail price inflation.

Additionally, the survey looks at the institutional investors' experiences regarding the private rented sector. The survey suggests that investment in residential property equity is likely to be done through larger portfolios, which tend to invest in housing directly.

It is based on a questionnaire survey that was conducted in four neighbourhoods redeveloped at different time periods in the past 15 years. The survey data suggest an overall low level of satisfaction across all four neighbourhoods. Only the unit size and length of stay significantly relate to residential satisfaction. The survey shows that low residential satisfaction does not lead to frequent moving behaviours despite high moving intentions. These findings contradict hypotheses in the Western literature about lower residential satisfaction associated with higher mobility. In Western studies, residential satisfaction determines housing adjustment and mobility behaviours, which form the basis for public intervention. The central assumption is that residents' mobility will be relatively unhindered by factors other than personal financial ability. By differentiating between voluntary and involuntary relocation behaviour, this paper attempts to understand the interrelationship between residential satisfaction, moving intention and moving behaviour within the context of China's political economy. Residents in this study showed a lack of ability to adjust their changing housing needs although they had strong desires to do so. China's housing reform provides a valuable opportunity to examine the impacts of constraints and choices on residential satisfaction, and sheds light on decision processes of housing market development.",China; Moving behaviour; Residential satisfaction,attitudinal survey; housing policy; inner city area; residential mobility; residential satisfaction; urban housing; Asia; Beijing [China]; China; Eurasia; Far East,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748506303,1

China's unprecedented waves of internal migration are accompanied by long-standing rural-urban and local-nonlocal divides that have been institutionalized through the household registration system. This paper empirically assesses intra-urban migrant mobility in two of China's largest cities, Beijing and Shanghai. It examines the range and determinants of migrant mobility behaviour and rates, tenure and spatial patterns of migrant intra-urban mobility, and key sources of information and assistance in migrant residential moves. The main findings are based on data drawn from city-wide migrant housing surveys, supplemented by in-depth interviews. Demographic factors such as age and education prove to be significant predictors of both actual moves and prospective mobility. Migrants who rent public housing as their initial housing choice are much less likely to make moves subsequently and experience a lower average mobility rate. Longer-term migrants seem to gain some degree of residential stability, making duration of residence the single most influential factor for mobility rate. However, the high rate of mobility is not necessarily driven by the need for tenure or even amenity as few migrants make the transition from renters to owners after years of living in the cities.",Housing; Migration; Residential mobility; Urban China,internal migration; residential mobility; social housing; urban housing; Asia; Beijing [China]; China; Eurasia; Far East; Shanghai,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748504775,1

Using a retrospective survey (1949-94) in 20 Chinese cities, it was found that while the overall mobility is low, it has fluctuated significantly over time with a recent rising trend, which corresponds to historical changes in housing policies. The longitudinal models show that while some factors such as change of marital status and work units have consistent effects on mobility over time, indicating the persistency of the socialist housing system, others such as housing tenure have different effects over time, demonstrating changes in the Chinese housing system. The results share some similarities with the Western models, yet they demonstrate significant differences despite recent market penetrations.

At present they are often the most deprived areas of European cities. The turnover of the population on these estates is characteristically rapid, leading to considerable socio-economic and socio-cultural changes and a multi-ethnic neighbourhood. Such areas often have to contend with severe physical, social and economic problems and the consequent dissatisfaction of the residents. This combination of rapid and selective population turnover and increasing numbers of problems may well affect aspects of social cohesion within these neighbourhoods, particularly the social networks. This process is regrettable, because social cohesion is regarded in a positive light, something that enhances the quality of life. Stimulating social cohesion is therefore an important objective of many policies that focus on large post-Second World War housing estates. The authors have found it interesting to discover how important social cohesion is in the opinions and the lives of the inhabitants rather than the policy makers. In their opinion, urban policies focus on social cohesion while the inhabitants' views of its relevance are unknown. On the basis of this paper, certain aspects of social cohesion in large post-Second World War housing estates appear to be valued, but housing market behaviour, such as residential moves, is hardly affected by aspects of social cohesion. Other aspects, such as moving to a better house, are much more relevant.

These debates have revealed weaknesses in the traditional ratio standard of affordability and led to arguments in support of an alternative, residual income concept of affordability. However, so far there has been only limited success in operationalising and applying the residual income approach in the UK. In the US, by contrast, arguments in support of a residual income approach to housing affordability emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s, culminating in the formulation of operational standards utilising normative family budgets. This paper draws upon the US experience to formulate a residual income housing affordability standard for the UK that utilises the non-shelter components of the Family Budget Unit (FBU) 'Low Cost but Acceptable' budgets as the normative standard for minimum adequate residual income. The paper concludes by suggesting how use of such a 'shelter' poverty standard to assess housing affordability problems and needs in the UK might yield results that differ from those based on the ratio standard. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",Housing affordability; Residual income; Shelter poverty,affordable housing; household income; social housing; standard (regulation); Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745308621,1

Despite the tremendous growth in Taiwanese immigrants during the 1980s, the Taiwanese homeownership rate was not only among the highest of all ethnic groups in 1990, but also recorded a phenomenal increase of 16 percentage points between 1980 and 1990. This paper examines this trend and assesses the contributing factors. It reveals that (1) education and wealth were contributors to Taiwanese high homeownership; (2) Chinese immigrants in general and Taiwanese immigrants in particular had endowment-adjusted homeownership rates well above that of non-Hispanic whites, while the ways in which ethnic Chinese immigrants achieve high homeownership were reflective of their distinctive paths of immigration; (3) surprisingly, higher English proficiency, an indicator of acculturation, was negatively associated with Taiwanese homeownership; (4) the large rise in Taiwanese homeownership in the 1980s was largely contributed to by young, highly educated, newly arrived Taiwanese with a low level of income and a high level of wealth. Findings refute the hypothesis that immigrants are always plagued by homeownership deficits. Well-off immigrants, such as the Taiwanese, may have followed a path of assimilation not yet documented in the literature; acculturation and social adaptation may no longer be preconditions for their economic integration. The arrival of well-off immigrants has a significant potential to bolster regional demand for owner-occupied housing. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",Adaptation; Homeownership; Los Angeles; Taiwanese immigrants,acculturation; Asian immigrant; economic integration; homeownership; California; Los Angeles; North America; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745300191,1

This paper estimates the potential housing market impacts of a tax credit targeted on rental housing affordable to low-income Australian households. The study finds that existing landlords in low-income rental housing benefit from a one-third or more reduction in their effective tax burdens. If these tax benefits are passed on in the form of lower market rents, it is estimated that the percentage of households paying more than 30 per cent of gross income in rents falls from 26 to 21 per cent. This impact would be larger but for eligible households in receipt of demand-side subsidies in the form of rent assistance. As a consequence, many low-income households receive only part of the low income housing tax credit benefits that are passed on into lower market rents. Moreover, higher income tenants occupy some of the cheaper rental housing targeted by tax credits, and this weakens the policy rationale for such supply-side measures. The paper advocates the adoption of headleasing arrangements to increase the share of benefits received by low-income tenants. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",Australia; Housing affordability; Low income tax credit; Microsimulation; Microsimulation model,affordable housing; low income housing; tax incentive; Australasia; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646112637,1

But, to the extent that housing quality and neighbourhood quality are inter-twined it is difficult to disentangle the extent to which households are more focused on one or another of these two components of the choice process. This paper uses both cross-tabulations of the neighbourhood choices, and logit models of the actual choices, to examine the relative roles of neighbourhoods and houses in the choice process. The research is focused on the question of the extent to which households trade up in house quality, or neighbourhood quality or both, as outcomes of residential mobility. The research measures neighbourhood quality in both socio-economic and environmental dimensions. The study shows that many households not only move up in housing quality, but quite consistently also make gains in neighbourhood quality, often independently of gains in housing quality. Not surprisingly, the largest gains in neighbourhood quality are related to households who make the city/suburban transition in their housing moves. The research adds another dimension to the growing and extensive literature on neighbourhoods and their role in residential choice. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",Neighbourhoods; Physical environment; Residential choice,logit analysis; neighborhood; preference behavior; residential mobility,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646087195,0

A cost/benefit theoretical conceptualization with a sample of 19 000 Russian immigrants who arrived in Israel in 1989-90 was used to examine how the benefits of homeownership (location, size and pricing) 'stood against' a set of costs (commuting time required, housing age and size). A set of demographic and human capital factors were employed to control for socio-economic effects such as age, gender, family size, labour force participation and occupational status. The benefits of homeownership for immigrants in Israel also proved to involve some costs: migrating to smaller localities and commuting to metropolitan areas where occupational opportunities are higher. The findings suggest that while homeownership is widespread, it imposes a burden on new immigrants as well. This implies that social policy with regard to housing, especially low-priced housing, should consider the possibility of expanding public and market services in an appropriate way that will increase social inclusion and lessen the likelihood of structural segregation. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",Housing attainment; Housing market; Isreal; Migration,affordable housing; cost-benefit analysis; homeownership; housing market; housing policy; immigrant population; social policy; Asia; Eurasia; Israel; Middle East,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646079391,0

It suggests that the discourse on, and justification of, housing market renewal has shifted from a specific concern with low housing demand and abandonment to a more generalised modernisation agenda seeking the restructuring of low-income neighbourhoods in terms not only of housing quality but also of tenure and population. This modernisation discourse is strongly linked to a regional economic regeneration agenda. It is argued that despite claims for the holistic nature of market renewal policies, it seems unlikely that these will improve the economic circumstances of existing residents as opposed to serving regional economic development objectives. Moreover, the more sweeping change implied by the modernisation agenda may reinforce the tension at neighbourhood level between community-led neighbourhood renewal and the restructuring of tenure and population through market renewal. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",Housing market renewal; Neighbourhood renewal; Regional economic regeneration,housing market; modernization; regional planning; urban renewal,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-31744444552,0

The case of Slovenia shows that, despite a low level of government support of homeowners, the homeownership rate has remained at its unsustainably high level and households continue to express strong preferences for homeownership. The paper explores factors explaining current homeownership preferences in Slovenia. A comprehensive model of housing preferences is built. The model follows the proposition that tenure preferences are strongly influenced by general cultural norms and factors characterising the social, economic and political environments. The model is tested using structural equation modelling based on a survey of Slovenian households. The results reveal that the strong preferences for homeownership in Slovenia can be explained by the firm perceptions of the financial advantages of homeownership and by the lack of available rental alternatives. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",Homeownership; Housing tenure choice; Preferences; Slovenia,homeowner; housing market; investment; privatization; Eurasia; Europe; Slovenia; Southern Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-31744443555,1

The questions addressed are: did the donor-funded investment induce beneficiaries to invest their own funds additionally, and, did beneficiaries invest more than their neighbors who did not participate in the program? Data used in the analysis are from household surveys conducted in three villages where the program operated; beneficiaries were interviewed at the time the construction was finished and again six months later; non-beneficiaries (controls) were interviewed six months after the program construction was completed. The study finds that direct program beneficiaries supplemented the publicly financed improvements and that the program may have induced non-beneficiaries to invest as well. For both groups, available household economic resources were the primary determinant of investments, although non-beneficiaries living in temporary housing were discouraged from undertaking improvements. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",Armenia; Donor programs; Earthquake replacement; Housing investment,earthquake; housing provision; investment; rural economy; Armenia; Asia; Eurasia; West Asia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-31744443039,1

However, there is a very large discrepancy between policy and practice and as a consequence urban development and housing delivery are intensely commodified sectors of the Taiwanese economy. The beneficiaries of urban development have primarily been the middle class and powerful development factions.

Each sought to provide individual 'ownership' of the flat and collective management of the block in which the flat was contained. Leasehold 'ownership' effectively retained the previous landlord-tenant relationship because of a peculiarity in English law that only allows 'positive covenants', such as maintenance obligations, to be enforced on the first purchaser of a flat, not subsequent purchasers. Although in Scotland outright individual ownership of a flat was legally possible, the management arrangements covering the common parts of the building have not proved satisfactory. Neither legal arrangement put in place an 'ownership' or 'governance' regime which matched popular cultural expectations of what individual homeownership should constitute.

The Final Report has quickly become one of the most important documents in housing policy for many years. Broadly, the Review examined the reasons for the weakness of English housing supply. For example, during the 1990s, despite the boom in house prices, private housing construction hardly grew at all. The weakness of supply is one reason why house prices in the UK have risen much faster than the European average. In response to the Review's conclusion that the land-use planning system is the main cause of supply shortages, England will be introducing affordability targets. Regional planning authorities will be required to release more land if they expect targets not to be met. Economic analysis and models will become central to the assessment. The Barker Review provides a good example of how economic analysis can be used to inform the policy debate. This paper looks at the economics underlying the Barker Review, concentrating on an analysis of supply elasticities and the required increases in construction to meet price targets. The latter has been particularly controversial since, under some assumptions, the analysis implies that housing construction in England needs to be approximately doubled in order to bring house price inflation down to European levels. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.",Affordability; Barker Review; Supply elasticities,affordable housing; housing policy; price dynamics; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-29244491137,0

The paper concludes that privatisation actually helps to strengthen the existing inequity between different social groups, in the sense that the privatisation policy supports senior government officials, many of whom are well situated both financially and socially, and ignores poor and low-income households. Privatisation also contributes to enhancing the inequality between better-off housing areas and poorer ones. Mixed ownership, and the lack of regulations about the duties and rights of owners and tenants after privatisation, also lead to serious degradation of common areas in all residential blocks. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.",Apartment buildings; Homeownership; Housing privatisation,homeownership; housing; privatization; Asia; Eurasia; Hanoi; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-29244480287,0

Inter-subjectivist approaches to positionality emphasise how social interactions within the field produce 'interpretative moments' and thereby consciously affect the process of knowledge production. Objectivist approaches to positionality emphasise the 'background thinking' that social researchers carry into the field, unexamined, as occupants of social positions that are class, gender etc. based. It follows that this (class, gendered) background thinking unconsciously influences the process of knowledge production. However, since this literature has had little impact on the field of housing and urban research, its relevance to these fields remains to be established and vice versa. In this paper, I discuss both of these approaches and find them helpful but limited in their relevance to housing and urban research. Since housing and urban research tends to be undertaken on behalf of 'policy funders', I argue that constant exposure to the 'disciplinary gaze' of those funders means that the positionality of housing and urban researchers is also moulded during the course of the academic career. This means that the positionality of housing and urban researchers is not simply established within the field nor carried into the field. Rather, the positionality of housing and urban researchers develops over time of constant exposure to the 'disciplinary gaze' of research funders and manifests itself in what Foucault refers to as 'docility', i.e. research practices intuitively and uncritically oriented to satisfying the needs and demands of research funders. I draw on my own research career experiences to demonstrate this argument and, in doing so, show how my docility manifested itself during recent 'policy funded' research into the housing and urban problems of visual impaired children. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.",Contract research; Disciplinary power; Epistemology; Positionality; Research methods,research work; social science and humanities,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-29244472818,0

There is a need to upgrade the living conditions of people on farms where they are currently residing, in order to ensure the right to adequate shelter as envisioned by the Constitution.

Urban consolidation, in the form of attached dwellings in medium- and high-density configurations, has become the predominant form of new residential development since the early 1990s. One of the largely untested claims for this policy is that it provides more housing choice for an increasingly diverse population and that simply building larger amounts of smaller housing in high-density concentrations will be sufficient to meet that demand. As a result, planning for higher density housing has been undertaken with little explicit recognition of the housing sub-markets higher density housing caters for or their specific spatial characteristics within the city. These issues are examined by an analysis of the socio-economic characteristics of areas with high concentrations of attached housing. These data are processed by factor analysis to identify and locate the range of sub-markets within attached housing and additional small area data used to fill out the market profiling. The results reveal that a range of specific housing needs are met by this form of housing with discriminative characteristics in certain locations. In other words, higher density housing is associated with a range of locationally specific and spatially distinctive sub-markets. These findings are particularly relevant and timely as a new metropolitan strategy is in preparation for Sydney where an estimated 60-70 per cent of new dwelling provision in the next 30 years will take place within existing suburbs through higher density redevelopment. Planning for such development must take into account the local markets for such accommodation which have very different characteristics in different parts of the city. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.",Housing sub-markets; Sydney; Urban consolidation,housing market; housing provision; metropolitan area; urban housing; urban planning; Australasia; Australia; Eastern Hemisphere; New South Wales; Sydney; World,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-26444477463,1

The system for rent setting in Sweden is partly based on a process of negotiation in which the annual change in actual rents is an outcome of negotiations between the local branch of the Swedish Union of Tenants and local municipal housing companies. One possible outcome of these negotiations could be change to the rental structure in the different neighbourhoods within the municipality. By allowing differences in negotiated rent outcomes in different neighbourhoods, a better relationship of rent level to tenant perception of neighbourhood quality can be achieved. It is the understanding of the authors that in a number of local-housing-market rent negotiations over the last decade, the parties involved have agreed on the need for and have consciously aimed towards making such adjustments. In this paper, regression analysis has been used to analyse data about rent levels for residential units from two cities in Sweden, namely Gothenburg and Luleå. It can be concluded that differentiated rents are indeed present, hence the existing rent-setting system in Sweden can be used to improve the relationship between rental structure and neighbourhood quality. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Negotiated rents; Neighbourhood quality; Rental housing market,housing conditions; rental sector; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Goteborg; Lulea; Norrbotten; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden; Vastra Gotaland; World,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-22144475149,1

The empirical study is based on administrative data of housing allowance recipients living in three major metropolitan areas of Sweden between the years 1994 and 2002. The results indicate that the housing allowance positively affects recipients' homeownership propensity in Sweden. Therefore the worry of a 'rental trap' is dismissed within the Swedish housing allowance system. Instead, we conclude that the Swedish housing allowance system is doing a fairly good job in supporting low-income households to obtain and maintain their homeownership. Furthermore, no evidence was found to indicate that the reform of the Swedish housing allowance system in 1996-97 essentially changed this fact. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",2SCML; Dynamic panel data; Endogeneity; Homeownership; Housing allowance,homeownership; investment; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden; World,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-22144467730,1

There was also evidence that disregard of home as a base for relationships and for childhood and a lack of understanding of the nodal nature of home and the importance of rootedness all had consequences in determining whether investment was efficient.

Data were collected through interviews with an informant from each household and energy surveys. Respondents were drawn from relatively poor households. The main health measure used in the analysis, respondent-assessed overall health, was statistically significantly related to other health indicators, including SF36 scores, the reported presence of limiting conditions and health care behaviours such as visiting the GP. Worse respondent self-assessed health was statistically significantly related to occupational, wealth and income measures of poorer socio-economic status. However, measures of heating satisfaction and sense of mastery displaced the socio-economic measures when they were included in the predictive logistic regression model for self-assessed respondent health. Objective home energy efficiency, measured by SAP ratings, was associated with health in the model independently of the subjective measure. The findings support other evidence that home energy efficiency makes an important contribution to the relationship between lower socio-economic status and poorer health, and document the combined relationship between objective and subjectively measured home energy efficiency and health. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Energy efficiency; Fuel poverty; Health; Socio-economic status,energy efficiency; health status; socioeconomic status,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-22144436309,1

The first two models can be considered as forms of residential accommodations (forms that provide security yet de-emphasize the importance of individuals' autonomy) because of the familiarity they maintain with hospital-type care. The other two housing models bear a greater resemblance to apartment-type resources (which further individuals' autonomy, but pose a risk of isolation). This study sheds light on the perception of people using mental health services regarding their quality of life and degree of empowerment in relation to these various types of housing. Twenty-one Montrealers were interviewed who were grappling with mental illness and are living in the four types of housing resources. One of the findings of this study is that access to suitable housing is a primary source of social integration.

The UK government wishes to make telecare available in all homes that need it by 2010. This expansion is seen as central to the improvement of older people's independence and quality of life by enabling them to live at home whenever possible. The paper discusses the range of initiatives now in place to facilitate the introduction of telecare in the UK. It argues that while there is now experience of telecare through pilot and demonstration schemes, moving to mainstream service delivery is far from straightforward. Using a case study of a telecare scheme, along with supplementary data from other schemes, the paper explores the reasons why it may be hard to meet government objectives. These include the organisational and cultural characteristics of local care institutions and the complexity of scheme objectives. It draws conclusions on the challenges in meeting aspirations for mass telecare over the next decade and on the future role of the housing stock in care provision. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Community care; Innovation; Smart housing; Telecare,elderly care; housing; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; World,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-19844378467,0

After providing a brief introduction to the development of non-market housing policy in Canada, this paper discusses the process of creating the Atkinson co-operative. The conversion of Atkinson has produced a new model of social housing, in that Atkinson operates neither as a pure housing co-operative nor as a public housing project, but rather as a synthesis of the two models, referred to as a hybrid, or an incorporated co-operative within the public sector. The features of the hybrid arrangement are grouped within the following categories: land/property; finances; property management and administration; governance and decision-making practices; education and community programs; housing charges/rents; and living in public housing. The final section of this paper locates the Atkinson experiment within the tenant-management literature in public housing and also discusses the conversion as a process in community development. Although it is premature to determine the efficacy of this model, the results are likely to influence the movement for increasing tenant involvement in the management of public housing. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Community development; Housing policy; Public housing,cooperative sector; social housing; Canada; North America; Western Hemisphere; World,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-19844374069,0

Using employment and housing history data drawn from interviews with professionals who rented flats from Camden Council in inner London, it is argued that they constitute an economically marginal part of the new middle class, that section of the middle classes typically associated with inner-city gentrification. The professionals in council housing were a mixture of self-employed artists and public sector welfare and educational employees, and the occupational career paths of this mainly female group tended to take fragmented forms. The paper also demonstrates the relevance of political and social values for understanding the location of these professionals within the London housing market. It is suggested that although the presence of the middle classes among council tenants in inner London boroughs such as Camden is likely to decline, the socio-economic and demographic factors underpinning the creation of marginal professionals are likely to persist. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Artistic and welfare professionals; Council tenants; New middle class,class; housing provision; urban housing; Eastern Hemisphere; England; Eurasia; Europe; London [England]; United Kingdom; Western Europe; World,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-19844368665,0

The determinants of these choices operate differently based on an individual's life cycle, particularly with regard to the presence or absence of children. Individuals with children often place value on greenspace and recreational opportunities, while those without children often prefer smaller residential lots and locations with access to services. Existing studies have found that if residential location desires are satisfied, people are less likely to emphasize the importance of job location irrespective of their life stage. Taking a different approach, this study examines home-workplace decisions from a commuting standpoint. Commute durations and personal characteristics are used to analyse individual behavior. The contributions of this work include the finding that environmental characteristics and amenities may explain the connection between commuting behavior and residential location choices.

In order to grasp differences in the nature of societies, the study uses the welfare state typology of Esping-Andersen (with the addition of a Mediterranean welfare state regime). In this (adapted) typology, four different welfare state regime types are distinguished: a social-democratic welfare state regime, a corporatist welfare state regime, a liberal welfare state regime and a Mediterranean welfare state regime. Different statistical techniques are used to investigate the relationship between welfare state regime type and dwelling type. First, a number of bivariate tables are presented that indicate how the incidence, tenure category, quality and the appreciation of single-family dwellings compared to apartments differ between welfare state regimes. Subsequently, there is an analysis of the bivariate relations between these aspects. To find out whether the typology of Esping-Andersen really is a useful classification system with regard to the characteristics and appreciation of single-family dwellings as against apartments, a cluster analysis is conducted. The clusters that result from this analysis are interpreted and compared with the typology of the four welfare state regimes. Based on the results of these statistical analyses, some conclusions are drawn and some directions for further research are outlined. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Dwelling types; International comparative housing research; Welfare state regimes,housing; social policy; typology,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-19844367877,1

These upper-class enclaves, using large tracts of land, spring up at the periphery of cities, which are, in developing countries, lower-class residential areas, creating striking urban contrasts. The municipalities of the second suburban ring of Buenos Aires, with high population growth rates and the poorest inhabitants of the whole metropolis, often have limited resources and great difficulties controlling their own urbanisation. Focusing on the example of the municipality of Pilar, 50 km north of Buenos Aires, an epicentre for the gated communities' boom, this paper shows that planning regulations, often obsolete, are poorly applied. If gated communities generate some economic development, it appears that suburban municipalities and the majority of their residents actually take very little advantage of the arrival of closed affluent neighbourhoods in their localities. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Buenos Aires; Gated communities; Town planning,gated community; residential development; suburban area; town planning; urban housing; Argentina; Buenos Aires [Argentina]; South America; Western Hemisphere; World,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-16344396455,1

However, the club goods theory alone does not enable one to understand the global but regionally differentiated development. Therefore, second, this paper proposes to view the analysis of private neighbourhoods as club economies against the background of historically and regionally differentiated patterns of urban governance which render urban development path-dependent.

In contrast to received wisdom, this paper argues that the theory of club goods can be used to understand gating as a response to both real and perceived issues of crime, vandalism and anti-social behaviour. It is suggested that gating can help to foster social cohesion in an area or neighbourhood by involving a wide spectrum of communities and income groups to create management vehicles which can: reduce crime, protect parked vehicles, increase safety and enhance the local environment by preventing unsolicited entry. Through two case studies, the paper explores how communities struggling with neighbourhood problems including crime are using gating as a way of improving their environment rather than abandoning poorer areas of the city to find a safer home in more residentially segregated affluent neighbourhoods. If housing and planning policy makers are to take seriously a commitment to resident democracy and local participation, such concerns should not be dismissed out of hand as examples of 'isolationism' or 'particularistic consumerist interests'. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Club goods; Gated communities; Residential segregation,crime; gated community; social problem; social segregation; urban housing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-16344384409,0

While the gate has existed in China for a long time as a physical form, it has now been rediscovered as an instrument for the partitioning of derelict socialist landscapes produced by 'economising urbanisation' and a post-socialist imagined 'good life'. The study highlights that the function of gating is dependent upon social and economic contexts: under socialism, gating reinforces political control and collective consumption organised by the state; in the post-reform era, the gate demarcates emerging consumer clubs in response to the retreat of the state from the provision of public goods. While the discourse of fear seems less applicable to the Chinese city, urban fragmentation is paving the way to a new urban experience of insecurity, which has begun to appear in the discourse of 'community building' in urban China. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Commodity housing; Gated community; Social inequalities; Urban China; Urban governance,gated community; state role; urban housing; urban society; Asia; China; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Far East; World,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-16344379739,0

In the US, they represent a substantial part of the new housing market, especially in the recently urbanised areas. They have thus become a symbol of metropolitan fragmentation. This paper focuses on how local governments consider them as a valuable source of revenue because suburbanisation costs are paid by the private developers and the final homebuyer, and how this form of public-private partnership in the provision of urban infrastructure ultimately increases local segregation. An empirical study in the Los Angeles region aims to evaluate this impact on socio-economic and ethnic patterns using factorial analysis (dissimilarity indices). As a result, the sprawl of gated communities increases segregation. Very significant socio-economic dissimilarities are found to be associated with the enclosure, thus defining very homogeneous territories, especially on income and age criteria. However, gated communities are located in ethnic buffer zones and stress an exclusion that is structured at a municipal scale. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Gated communities; Segregation; Urban sprawl,gated community; neighborhood; social segregation; urban development; urban housing; California; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-16344376926,0

Taiwan's experience of Home Owners Associations (HOAs) is used to show that entrepreneurs have a strong incentive to deliver private governance capacity and are apparently more effective in doing so than either government (by coercion) or residents (by voluntary association). However, government needs to reduce certain collective action costs by providing appropriate enabling legislation. While the market can deliver private democratic government, it cannot do so in a way that avoids many of the costly features of public government. Within HOAs, problems of information asymmetry and opportunism, collective action and rent-seeking all persist. The paper concludes that much of the efficiency of contractual democratic neighbourhoods comes through the privatisation of bureaucracy-handing over civic goods and services supply and management to highly competitive and innovative property companies-rather than through HOA governance structures per se. The latter are characterised by many of the same problems that weigh down conventional municipal government. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Collective action; Gated communities; Homeowners association; Institutional evolution; Neighbourhoods; Rent-seeking; Taiwan; Transaction costs,collective action; governance approach; homeowner; housing management; neighborhood; Asia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Far East; Taiwan; World,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-16344371133,0

New housing developments must be governed by private homeowner associations and existing neighbourhoods are under pressure to become private communities.

This paper draws on empirical research carried out in a gated community in the north of England to explore social ties amongst the residents, in the presence of a legal framework (lease and residents' management company) which provides behavioural rules, sanctions and a structure for resident management of the development. The data suggest that gated residents' rights and responsibilities are, by and large, confined to legalities, rather than extending to a commitment to enhance social networks either within the development or in the adjacent wider community. The paper concludes that gated communities of the type discussed here, ready-made new developments introduced into established neighbourhoods, may also exacerbate the effect of physical and social barriers between residents within and outside the gated community. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Community; Gated community; Leasehold; Legal sanctions; Resident management; Social capital,community development; gated community; residential development; social network; urban society; Eastern Hemisphere; England; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; World,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-16344367759,1

Fearing an imminent economic slump, the government was urged by various housing developers and concerned local parties to intervene and re-activate the flagging housing market. The government, for its part, had realized beforehand the need for an immediate strategy to stimulate the market, and thus launched and implemented the 4 per cent Interest Rate Subsidy Scheme to first-time homebuyers in August 1996. After six years of handing out subsidies to first-time homebuyers, the scheme ended in June 2002, having had an obvious positive impact on the property market: a revived local market dynamic as well as a boost in investment. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",4 per cent interest-rate subsidy; Housing market; Macao government intervention,empowerment; housing market; housing policy; tenure relations; Asia; China; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Far East; Macau; World,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-13444269009,0

Before the publication of the Memorandum, associations had already developed various innovative types of tenure, for example fixed rent contracts, tenant maintenance programmes and different forms of sale with discounts and risk-reducing conditions. With the introduction of these tenures, associations aim to contribute to their social objectives by improving tenants' satisfaction with their dwellings and to improve the market position of their stock as well. Our paper discusses innovative types of tenure that have been developed by the Dutch housing associations and their benefits and risks for tenant and landlord. We focus on the 'Client's Choice' programme that has been developed by the association Woonbron-Maasoevers, which is recognised as a front-runner in offering households a wide range of choice in tenure and which is also illustrative of many of the benefits and risks of the innovative tenures. We conclude that many of the innov ative tenures, including the Client's Choice programme, can contribute to tenant empowerment and freedom of choice. However, low-income households will mostly have to keep relying on (social) rented housing and other forms of empowerment. For the landlord, the Client's Choice programme has the benefit of increasing cash flow, which can be used for (social) housing investments. However, there are also substantial financial risks, concerning the rate of sales, the development of market values and the potential costs of having to buy back all the dwellings at the end of their economic lifespan. Thus, the implementation of the Client's Choice programme on a large scale should be accompanied by measures to control or provide for these risks. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",Social housing; Tenant empowerment; Tenure,empowerment; housing policy; innovation; tenure relations; Benelux; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; Western Europe; World,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-13344283392,0

Discourses of high-rise housing that have seen this housing type change from one characterised by urban decay and family disorganisation to that which unproblematically glorifies this new housing form will be explored. These new and inviting images of high-rise living today are juxtaposed with the understandings of high-rise public housing that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. High-rise public housing was once seen as a solution to housing the impoverished and arresting the spread of slum conditions.

The evaluation undertaken here takes a critical stance towards the ways in which the partnership principle has been adopted and the policy guidance that requires it as a near-compulsory model. It is argued that, to date, there is little interest in the managerial effectiveness of partnerships and the broader implications of this for regeneration policy. A survey of the contemporary regeneration literature is undertaken to highlight the partial and inconclusive nature of most existing evaluations of partnerships, particularly given the emphasis on the role of local community leaders in the formulation and implementation of partnership projects. Then, some wider issues of the 'political economy' of urban policy are considered in the context of the partnership approach. This is followed by a juxtaposition of trends in property development in general with urban regeneration partnership management processes. Finally, it is concluded that the partnership ideal is a useful policy device but that it has to be thought through more clearly and applied in specific contexts, rather than seen as the best and universally applicable model of urban regeneration. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",Partnerships; UK; Urban regeneration,conflict management; partnership approach; urban planning; urban renewal; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; World,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-13344277261,0

A recent study has identified a substantial group of poor owner-occupiers, who suffer from chronic illness but currently receive little in the way of housing or health support. Aimed at people who have serious coronary disease, the 'Housin g for Healthier Hearts' project in Bradford has shown that a short-term task-centred programme of intervention and support by housing and health workers - focusing on immediate health-care concerns and specific housing improvement - can make a rapid and substantial difference to health and quality of life and the ability of residents to retain independence. Nevertheless there was concern that multi-agency participation - prominent at policy level, and crucial to the success of the SP programme - proved far more difficult to effect at 'grass roots'.

After a conceptual introduction, we present our research methodology, which combines quantitative and qualitative methods. The following section then briefly describes the socio-historical background of three permanently inhabited holiday parks, which serve as case studies for this paper. The empirical results focus on the geography of pathways, stressing housing situations before and beyond permanent habitation of holiday parks.

Using historical materials from the 1930s to the present, it argues that the discourse of community has now become a focus for asserting the independence of the housing association sector from control by the state. It begins by examining the period from the 1930s to 1960, when the marginal role of housing associations left them relatively free to define their own concepts of 'community', though with some contestation around the power of local authorities to nominate tenants. It then examines the 1960s and 1970s, when the increasing importance of the association sector in inner city renewal began a shift of emphasis towards providing housing on the basis of need. The paper moves on to consider the impact of rising homelessness in the 1980s, which led to the problematisation of housing association activity. The 1993 Page Report focused associations on their dependence on local authority definitions of housing need. It produced a 'paradigm shift' in the sector. Associations sought independence from local authority perceptions of housing need, moving towards policies of building communities that offered security to associations, lenders and occupiers. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",Community; Governmentality; Housing associations; Local authorities,governance approach; housing association; housing management; local government; power relations,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-11944268661,0

It then considers the force of these arguments in respect of New Labour's approach to anti-social tenants. The paper concludes that it is possible to formulate a powerful case for the kinds of measures that New Labour is currently taking by integrating elements of the three justifications. It is argued that it is a mistake to view such measures as necessarily disciplinary in intent or in effect. Measures to enforce the obligations that people owe to each other are not incompatible with policies to widen opportunities for self-fulfilment and to reduce social exclusion.

Unequal access to quality education is a critical dimension of participation in or exclusion from the knowledge-based economy, yet in a housing market dominated by home ownership, access to oversubscribed schools can be determined by the ability to afford housing in particular areas. Alongside this, school popularity may also impact on neighbourhood composition, thus making schools influential in the socio-economic profile of their local neighbourhoods. A key question for policy makers, then, is to what extent this occurs. This paper presents a review of the existing research on the relationship between school choice and housing decisions, focused around the question of what evidence exists to indicate how seriously school choice interacts with neighbourhood composition.

The paper also attempts to think through the wider theoretical and urban policy impacts of gating. In contrast to the view that gated communities provide an extreme example of residential segregation we go further and argue that the time-space trajectories of residents suggest a dynamic pattern of separation that goes beyond the place of residence. Gated communities appear to provide an extreme example of more common attempts by other social groups to insulate against perceived risk and unwanted encounters. Patterns of what we term time-space trajectories of segregation can thereby be seen as closed linkages between key fields, such as work and home, which enable social distance to be maintained and perceived risks to be managed by elite social groups. We conclude that gated communities further extend contemporary segregatory tendencies in the city and that policy responses are required which curtail the creation of such havens of social withdrawal. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",Gated communities; Segregation elites,gated community; social segregation; spatiotemporal analysis; urban planning; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; World,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-11944252401,0

Analysis reveals that disabled people with mobility impairments encounter barriers which are physical, attitudinal and systemic. Conclusions are reached that disabled people meet barriers at the initial stages of buying a home because they are not taken into account at the design stage.

LTH were intended to offset the concerns of first, the house buying public of the appearance and affordability of homes suitable for successive generations, second, the private house building industry of the cost and marketability of incorporating 'inclusive' design features, and third, Registered Social Landlords (RSLs), who had to balance cost constraints with addressing the needs of a growing number of households with older and/or disabled people. Approved Document Part M of the building regulations was extended in 1999, from public buildings to private dwellings, and currently requires that all new housing meet minimal 'visitability' criteria. Indeed, although the signs are that Part M will be incrementally extended to comprise LTH principles, the paper argues that in their existing form they are insufficient to act as a key component of the government's 'new agenda for British housing'. This paper therefore explores how they might usefully be expanded from an approach, largely based on compromise, to one that inspires innovative, flexible and inclusive house forms, which also challenge design conventions. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Building regulations; Disability; Housing design,design; disability; housing conditions; housing provision,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-5044238979,0

However, little is known of the ways in which housebuilders conceptualise the needs of those who do not conform to 'able-bodied' norms and how this impacts on their dealing with such groups. Drawing on the experiences of disabled people accessing the private housing market, this paper explores the processes of negotiation which take place between disabled house buyers and housebuilders during the purchase of new-build property. It is argued that underlying practical discussions around the (re)design of properties are negotiations around the concepts of disability and difference. These are played out and become apparent through the various roles assumed by each group. For example, lacking an institutional awareness of the needs of different bodies in domestic space, housebuilders are faced with the challenge of (re)viewing the needs and capacities of these 'Other' bodies.

The paper concludes by discussing the possibilities and challenges facing the housebuilding industry in engaging with the needs of disabled people and the role disabled people themselves can play in this. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Disability; Housebuilding; Housing quality,construction; disability; housing; negotiation process,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-5044232140,0

Technology, especially so-called 'smart home' technology, can only be used to assist people if it is effectively designed. Designers are therefore required to consider certain key questions such as what situation they are designing for, what solutions should do, and who should use them. The focus in this paper is on understanding and identifying user needs and system requirements for dependability in the complex challenge of inclusive design. The feature of inclusive design addressed here is the new emphasis on the user, a living, breathing person situated in real world settings along with others, rather than some designer's abstraction. The acceptance or rejection of assistive technology relies on the users' perceptions of the designed technology as well as the appropriateness of the technology designed. Consequently, this paper suggests that despite highly imaginative views of future technologies, getting such dreams to work generally means they must, at some point, meet the real world and engage with the needs of users if they are to be sufficiently grounded. Given this emphasis on users, the highly personal character of domestic settings presents conventional research techniques with obdurate problems that can make research practically and ethically difficult. Researching domestic spaces and domestic values requires different methods to understand the unique needs and experiences of residents. Accordingly, the authors report on their experiences of using observational studies and adapting 'cultural probes' to foster an ongoing dialogue with the members of their user groups, to gain insights into their needs and generate design relevant information and inspiration. The paper discusses how such information might feed into dependable design through consideration of a model of dependability. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Assistive technology; Designs for dependability; Support systems,design; elderly population; housing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-5044229234,0

A Conservative government elected in 1995 introduced an Act to deregulate rents and amend the Ontario Human Rights Code to allow use of income criteria to screen potential tenants. Document review and in-depth interviews with tenant advocates were applied to understand how tenant advocates in Toronto used knowledge and other strategies to influence the legislation in the context of a new framework of policy change. The findings revealed that while different forms of knowledge, scientific, anecdotal and critical, had some influence on the process, the political ideology of the government played a significant role in determining the influence of opponents to legislation. The research concludes that while the neo-liberal political ideology of the government did not consistently influence policy making in all areas, housing policy was particularly sensitive to political ideology. While the views of tenants did not influence the Conservative government, they did influence the policies of the Opposition parties that called for the restoration of social housing and rent control. On 2 October 2003, an Opposition party supporting these positions was elected in the Ontario general election. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Ontario housing policy; Political ideology; Rent regulation/deregulation,housing policy; policy development; political ideology; rental sector; Canada; North America; Ontario,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3843129771,0

It is expected that the way in which income-related housing support schemes in both countries are designed and administered may come under closer scrutiny.

However, there were difficulties from the start, many arising from the division of authority for setting programme parameters among different levels of government and the potential for variation in the treatment of similar households in different cities. In 1996, the programme's original simple basis for benefit determination was seriously impaired by the introduction of different principles for very low-income households. Moreover, local governments have exhibited a willingness to vary benefits from year-to-year, depending on political and budgetary considerations. The analysis presented here documents the impact of these variations on participation rates in a sample of Russian cities. Large inequities are obviously present in the treatment of similar households from city to city. Indeed, it is questionable whether the programme as currently configured is fulfilling the social safety net function envisioned for it in the original legislation. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Housing allowances; Transition economy,decentralization; economic instrument; housing policy; strategic approach; transitional economy; Eurasia; Russian Federation,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3843111314,0

In the last few decades, the rise in home ownership in the Netherlands has been spectacular. This would imply that the population has become less mobile, which has consequences for the functioning of the housing market-at least, if the relationship between home ownership and residential mobility has not changed. This research addresses the question of whether the effect of home ownership on the probability of residential mobility has changed over the last few decades and if so, how. Using data from the 1981-98 Netherlands Housing Demand surveys and logistic regression models, it is found that the difference between home owners and renters in residential mobility has changed over time. The results indicate a decrease in the effect of home ownership with an interruption in 1984-85.

However, in the current policy' it is not clear whether the primary aim is to address the problems of individuals, or if the aim is to change the market position of the distressed areas. The intervention might be successful in terms of assisting residents in finding jobs and better education, but that might not improve the general position of the areas targeted, since people who make a socio-economic career very often move out of the areas, to be replaced by poorer and less well-established residents. By drawing upon a comprehensive and unique set of data the paper analyses the issues of residential mobility and selective migration, with special focus on distressed neighbourhoods in the Stockholm region. The results clearly indicate that the migration flows of these neighbourhoods are indeed selective. The people who move in are more likely to be unemployed and dependent on social benefits and have on average lower incomes than those who move out and those who remain in the neighbourhoods. This simultaneous outflow of relatively well-off residents and inflow of weaker and more marginalised groups has the effect of reproducing the distressed character of the neighbourhoods. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Area-based urban policy; Distressed neighbourhoods; Selective migration,mobility; neighborhood; social exclusion; social policy; strategic approach; urban policy; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3843084123,1

Although an implicit theme of much of the discourse is the role of the state in controlling the factors of production, this is not located within the decommodfication/commodification debate. Proceeding from the premise that underlies much of economic theory, namely that land values at a time reflect the residual (or surplus) of economic activity that requires land as a factor input, the purpose of this paper is to assess the extent to which the Korean state has managed the commodification of urban development and the distributional effects of this process. In spite of private land ownership the state has had a major impact on the processes by which land has become commodified, using extensive land expropriation and land-use planning powers. The Korean state used different strategies to manage trends to commodification at different times: land readjustment projects were used from the 1950s to the 1970s and Public Management Development projects were the main mechanism of urban development from the 1980s. The urban development system was feasible because of the state's extensive control over access to housing finance (decommodified money). In the mid-1990s there was a shift towards greater private sector involvement in urban development. The distributional effects of the urban development process have been highly inequitable. Subsidised home ownership for middle-income families has been favoured over provision of public rental housing for low-income families, driven in major part by cash flow considerations of the developmentalist state. Further, the basis of selecting beneficiaries has been very arbitrary. The system has promoted significant land concentration and land speculation particularly by private companies, including the large chaebol (corporations). © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Commodification; Housing; South Korea; Urban development,housing policy; land market; strategic approach; urban development; urban planning; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Korea; South Korea,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3843073267,1

First, based on a literature study, it identifies the factors in the development of house prices. Then, using data from several European countries, it compares the effects of personal income tax reform on the development of house prices. As the comparison reveals, the method and timing of adjustments in the tax system have a strong influence on house price development.

This research asks an as-yet unanswered spatial question: where do those suffering high rates of housing affordability stress reside and what do the spatial patterns imply about policies intended to address this housing problem? This paper tabulates and maps the spatial distribution of households that pay excessive amounts of their income for rent in order to identify locations within metropolitan regions where housing affordability stress is greatest. It is found that significant unevenness characterises the spatial distribution of housing affordability problems in major Canadian census metropolitan areas (CMAs). Only a minority of places conform to the North American stereotype that concentrates this problem near the city centre. Where some CMAs have concentrations of the problem in the inner city or, alternatively inner suburb, other metropolitan areas exhibit a more diffuse pattern of housing in-affordability. The locus of the problem is also variable depending on whether the household is of the family or non-family type. The interpretation of the uneven patterns relates broadly to features of supply and demand that have been identified in previous research. From both a policy and theoretical perspective this work demonstrates that greater attention needs to be paid to the spatial aspects of housing affordability and to the related, economically-induced risk of homelessness in Canadian metropolitan areas. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Canadian metropolitan areas; Homelessness; Housing affordability stress; Inner city; Inner suburbs; Outer suburbs; Poverty,affordable housing; homelessness; housing policy; metropolitan area; social exclusion; urban housing; Canada; North America,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3142772083,1

While affordability problems increased consistently over the last two decades for almost all classes of households, the problems are highly concentrated among those with low-incomes. Women household maintainers are significantly more likely to experience problems and the number of income recipients in a household is a key indicator of a potential problem. While all regions and major cities had increasing problems, the data show major differences across regions and urban centres. No correlation is found between the growth of cities or the growth in rent levels and the growth of the proportion of low-income households with severe affordability problems. Housing prices were remarkably stable during the 1990s and cannot be claimed as the main cause of the escalating problem. However, strong correlations relate the growth of affordability problems to city size and to the prevailing rent level, suggesting that land rent is a factor in determining the problem's spatial incidence and that continued concentration of the population in major cities will continue to fuel the growth of the problem. The most disturbing finding is that, for the most vulnerable groups, the prevalence and severity of affordability problems worsened during the 1990s, reflecting the consequences of a larger and longer trend toward increasing income inequality in Canadian society. The paper points to other research which links the affordability issue to homelessness and argues that the trends in affordability burdens be considered as ripe for serious policy intervention at all three levels of government. While specific policy conclusions cannot be based on this study, the results do point to the growing need for a change in Canadian housing policy. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Homelessness; Housing affordability; Metropolitan effects,affordable housing; homelessness; housing policy; low income housing; metropolitan area; urban housing; Canada; North America,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3142760210,1

Extant evidence on these issues is either old or indirect. This paper provides direct evidence on these issues using new data from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality. The results suggest that (1) whites' neighbourhood racial preferences play an important role in explaining the racial composition of their neighbourhoods; (2) inter-racial contact in neighbourhoods and workplaces leads to a greater willingness among whites to live with blacks; and (3) although younger and more educated whites express a stronger taste for integration than other whites, the magnitude of these differences leads to only a small increase in the black percentage of the neighbourhood. In addition, the results provide no evidence in support of the hypothesis that whites stereotype black neighbourhoods rather than blacks per se. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",3SLS; Neighbourhood; Segregation,neighborhood; race; residential location; social segregation; urban society; North America; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3142748408,1

Yet it is increasingly apparent that a welfare state will survive, albeit in a restructured form. This paper examines the place of RTB in the restructuring of social rented housing in the UK and accounts for recent changes to it. A new politics of RTB has arisen from the restructuring of social housing. As the politics of welfare shifted its focus from the scale of welfare provision to reorganising, adjusting and 'modernising' what remained, RTB came into question. This, along with political devolution, has created a new set of conditions that have called RTB into question in different parts of the UK while paradoxically it continues to be widely perceived as inviolable. RTB now occupies an ambiguous and slightly troublesome position as a feature of a residualised social rented sector that is more secure in its role of meeting social needs, as well as being seen to provide a route to owner occupation. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Devolution; Right to buy; Social rented housing; Welfare restructuring,devolution; homeownership; housing policy; social housing; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3142748406,0

Whether such a definition is broad and inclusive of squatters, and those living in particularly poor quality housing, or narrowly focused on street homelessness, it is likely to include a large population. Therefore, we are left with a need to develop criteria for identifying, allocating and prioritising appropriate support.

It highlights the way in which homeless people, living in identical shelter situations, and for ostensibly similar reasons, might require different responses to support them out of homelessness.

The study finds evidence that the policies were, indeed, effective in reducing home ownership disparities between whites and non-whites. In this study data from the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey (NYCHVS) are used to examine ethnic/racial home ownership rate disparities. Decompositions are performed to determine the component of home ownership rate differentials due to ethnic/racial group characteristics versus ability to translate those characteristics into home ownership. Presumably, a shift in public policy to be more ethnically and racially inclusive should reflect a change in home ownership rate disparities and, more particularly, a change in the component of those disparities attributed to differential ability to translate group characteristics into home ownership rates. Hence, this study addresses the success of recent policies to foster the opportunity of achieving the 'American dream' for non-white families. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Home ownership; Inter-ethnic disparities; Inter-racial disparities; New York City,homelessness; housing policy; racial disparity; urban housing; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; North America; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3142661920,1

It comprises 56 per cent of the total housing stock, while home ownership comprises only 19 per cent, lower than anywhere else in the Netherlands, and among the lowest in the world. Central government policy is currently seeking to increase the share of home ownership in the Netherlands from 53 per cent (2001) to 65 per cent in 2010. This paper will summarise recent national and local (Amsterdam) housing policy developments, focusing on the recent practice of selling social housing in Amsterdam. Unlike the Right to Buy scheme in Britain, the Netherlands employs an 'offer to buy' strategy. Sales, however, have been disappointing so far. Two factors were found to be crucial in this regard: (1) the sluggish change in 'policy mentality' and bureaucracy and (2) the high prices in the home ownership market. By way of conclusion, the paper reflects on the desirability of shifting the tenure structure from tenancy to ownership and on the risks that an (over-) emphasis on home ownership may bring. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Amsterdam; Home ownership; Housing associations; Housing policy; Right to buy; Social housing; The Netherlands,homeownership; housing policy; planning practice; rental sector; social housing; Amsterdam; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; North Holland; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3142657385,0

Increased Israeli settlements, the large size of Palestinian families, the deteriorating economic situation, the lack of national banks operating in the field of housing, the presence of refugee settlements containing over 1.2 million people, the Israeli state's policy of residential demolition and land confiscation have all combined to present a severe obstacle to urban reconstruction in the region. In an attempt to address these issues and to make some progress towards realising the estimated 180 000 housing units required by the Palestinian people, the Palestinian Housing Council (PHC) was established in 1992 (Abd Alhadi, 1994; Ziara, 1997). Although it has had some success, the organisation has been plagued by reports of internal dissent and disputes with its beneficiaries. This paper seeks to cast some light on these controversies by focusing on the PHC's role in the Elkarama Housing Project in the Gaza Strip during the period 1993 to 2000. It will first outline the broader context in which public institutions within the Gaza Strip operate before offering an account of the structure and background of the PHC. It will then consider Elkarama itself and will conclude by summing up the various factors that have determined the project's outcome. Finally, the paper will offer some tentative recommendations for improved housing provisions within the Gaza Strip in the future. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Housing reconstruction; Israeli occupation; Palestine; Palestinian housing council,housing conditions; housing management; housing policy; housing provision; Asia; Eurasia; Gaza Strip; Middle East; Occupied Territories,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-16544382039,0

There is now widespread agreement amongst housing economists that submarkets should be adopted as a working hypothesis but the concept has been reformulated in terms of intra-urban relative house price differentials. The accepted test for submarket existence uses a hedonic model of house prices which assumes market equilibrium. This paper returns to an analysis of submarkets which focuses on spatial migration patterns. By examining household intra-urban mobility patterns in the Glasgow housing market it is possible to demonstrate that submarkets tend to be self-contained. The analysis also suggests that the current standard statistical tests may be incomplete and in the case of Glasgow underestimate the number of submarkets. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.,Filtering; Glasgow; Migration; Prices; Submarkets; Urban,housing market; market conditions; migration; residential mobility; urban housing; Eurasia; Europe; Glasgow [Glasgow (UNA)]; Glasgow [Scotland]; Scotland; United Kingdom; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-16544378240,1

In this context, the paper explores issues around accommodating nomadism. Drawing primarily on the findings of research carried out by the author on behalf of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, it establishes that a number of Gypsies/Travellers actively pursue a traditional travelling lifestyle. Culturally-specific accommodation, mainly in the form of residential Gypsy sites, is inadequate to accommodate the desired amount of movement without unauthorised encampments. Unauthorised encampments fail to provide adequate standards for Gypsies/Travellers, tend to perpetuate their social exclusion and lead to friction with the settled community. A network of transit sites and stopping places is needed to accommodate travelling. The main barrier to provision is the planning system and, more fundamentally, resistance from the settled population to the idea of new sites for Gypsies and Travellers. The nature of nomadism itself also makes its accommodation difficult, especially in a society where settled 'sedentarist' interests are paramount and other lifestyles may be viewed as deviant. Several proposals are made which might assist policy making. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Gypsies/Travellers; Gypsy sites; Unauthorized encampments,gypsy people; housing policy; housing provision; lifestyle; nomadic people; England; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-16544375593,0

In particular, previous research has tended to rely upon single, binary measures of housing tenure (home owners versus renters). These broad categories do not capture the heterogeneity that exists within housing tenure classifications. This paper uses an expanded measure to differentiate home owners with mortgages, from those who do not have mortgages and from those who live in rental accommodation. The results reveal a gradient in housing tenure and psychological distress; individuals in rental situations report the highest levels of distress, home owners without mortgages the lowest levels. Moreover, housing tenure modifies the impact of stress oil distress in these data. The findings are interpreted in the context of changes to housing policy in Canada, and the economic climate during the period in which these data were collected.

It finds that the nation's credit market shifted away from less creditworthy borrowers under the macroeconomic dislocation and financial stress of the 1970s and 1980s, and returned to these borrowers amid the favourable macroeconomic conditions and a transformed financial industry during the 1990s. This pattern is generally confirmed by a simple simulation, in that gaps in the growth of ability to finance between the White/higher-income family and the African American/lower-income family widened during the 1970s' and 1980s' economic expansion, and narrowed during the 1990s' economic expansion. The simulation model also shows the interplay between two dimensions of the portfolio factors, mortgage interest rates and family income.

Most of this housing is easily identifiable high-rise estates. Some of these estates have become established centres of heroin dealing and drug use. This has had significant consequences: applicants reject offers of housing on the estates; tenants apply for transfers; and housing officers face workplace occupational health and safety issues. In sum, the presence of the drug trade is undermining the provision of affordable, well-located public housing. This paper contributes to discussions that seek to restore the value of this common resource. It does so by drawing on qualitative interviews and focus groups conducted with heroin users who live in and/or use public housing. The experience of these individuals gives insight into the current relationship between the illicit drug trade and public housing, as well as some understanding of the resilience of the illicit drug trade. The paper looks at measures that have been implemented to address this problem, before questioning whether there is room for an innovative, regulatory response to illicit drug use. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Drug policy; Heroin use; Housing policy; Inner-city public housing,drug user; housing management; inner city area; low income housing; social housing; Australasia; Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-12344282824,0

Various solutions to the problem are discussed including certification, contingent contracts and reputation-building. An empirical analysis based on a recent survey of estate agents suggests that a link between reputation and the form of contract signed may help to reduce the problems in the market.

Yet many of the changes in housing finance that supported sustainable home ownership also lured a new generation of subprime and predatory credit institutions specialising in high-cost, high-risk lending. For many urban and minority neighbourhoods, the old problems of exclusionary redlining are now accompanied by new dilemmas of exploitive greenlining. This paper analyses the market penetration of subprime lending institutions and the subsequent concentration of mortgage 'pre-foreclosures' in low- and moderate-income, African American neighbourhoods. Focusing on Newark, NJ, and its surrounding suburbs, Gary King's ecological inference technique and a series of logistic regression models are used to assess the role of borrower characteristics, institutional divisions, and neighbourhood context in the process of mortgage market segmentation. The evidence corroborates theories emphasising the dynamics of capital investment, financial services restructuring, and the economic incentives for racial-geographic targeting, and not the presumed credit deficiencies of urban and minority home owners. Unfortunately, the tidy empirical analysis offered here is overshadowed by the enormous societal experiment now underway across the US, as a wave of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures undermines the belated minority home ownership gains achieved during the unprecedented boom of the 1990s.",Capital investment; Discrimination; Redlining; Subprime lending,capital market; housing market; investment; mortgage lending; New Jersey; Newark; North America; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0842312492,1

Three hypotheses were formulated: (H1) Increased 'internal' competition, measured by the market share of the municipal housing company (that dominates the market and is price-leader according to the Swedish system of rent regulation), leads to lower rents. (H2) Increased 'external' competition measured by the price level on the market for single-family owner occupied housing, leads to lower rents. (H3) Lower capital expenditure in the municipal housing company leads to lower rents. The statistical analysis showed a strong correlation between the rent level and the level of external competition, but no relation was found for the level of internal competition and the level of capital expenditure. A possible conclusion is that policies that make it easier for households to leave the rental market are important for increasing the pressure on the firms in the rental sector and reducing rents.",Competition; Public housing; Rent level; Rental housing market,housing market; market conditions; price dynamics; rental sector; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0842269248,1

The consequence of this new mix should be that people interact better and fully enjoy all kinds of facilities in the restructured area. This paper addresses the question of whether this new policy has indeed had these effects. The focus point is the role of the neighbourhood, featuring changes for traditional inhabitants while accommodating the newcomers. Do they use the area? Are their social contacts made there?

It advances a five-equation, simultaneous system for home ownership, mobility expectations, housing wealth, household socio-economic status and neighbourhood character. Although current US census data do not provide perfect proxies for neighbourhood processes, there is evidence that a battery of them could represent reasonable operationalisations. Tests for non-linearity could be conducted in this framework. This model could use a sufficiently robust set of instrumental variables to overcome the issue of neighbourhood selection bias, and thereby produce considerably more precise estimates of neighbourhood impacts on individual outcomes of interest.

For years, this question has received widespread international attention in scholarly debates and within society at large. This paper seeks to contribute to this discussion by presenting the results of an investigation into the relationship between household social mobility and the composition of the residential environment. The analyses are based on an extensive empirical longitudinal study conducted in the Netherlands. The most remarkable conclusion is that, in the Dutch context, the environment has only a modest influence on the social mobility of households with a weak economic position. It was found that the chance of a household living purely on welfare benefits at the beginning of the study period to escape the 'welfare trap' was barely dependent on the number of similarly challenged households in the immediate vicinity. Interestingly, the environment proved to have a more powerful effect on the social mobility of households with a stronger economic position. The probability that households with at least one paid job at the beginning of the research would still have a job at the end clearly decreases as the share of benefit-dependent households in the neighbourhood rises. A possible explanation for this is that for the first category (weak starting position) the negative effect of their own welfare situation is far more determinative for their future prospects than the composition of their environment. Because these negative individualistic conditions are absent for the second category (stronger starting position), environmental factors may play a relatively larger role. Another interpretation is that area-based policies are not just targeting the areas with bigger problems more intensively, but especially the long-term unemployed in these areas, and not so much the short-term unemployed (those who had a job at the start of the research period and lost the job afterwards).",Longitudinal; Neighbourhood effects; Social mobility; The Netherlands,mobility; neighborhood; socioeconomic status; urban society; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344066297,1

As a result, private enterprise is also eclipsed in most accounts of housing and housing policy in the early post-war period. This paper draws on the British experience to show that if the policy narrative is traced from wartime plans rather than from post-war action, and if the question of who actually built post-war social housing is raised, then a different picture emerges. From the middle of 1942 British civil servants and ministers were engaged in detailed planning for post-war housing, in both the short and long term. Private enterprise was assumed to have a major role to play in the long term, and a supporting role in the transitional period. In practice the post-war Labour Government relied on local authorities as housing developers, who themselves relied on private contractors to build the houses.

The effect of specific residential perceptions on overall satisfaction with the home and neighbourhood is traced through moving intentions to actual moves over the 1991-96 period. Using a sample of matching respondents surveyed twice in 1991 and 1996, the paper also examines whether changed residential perceptions affect moving intentions.

The old system was dominated by work units that provided substantial in-kind services to their employees, including heavily subsidised housing. It brought three serious problems: housing shortages, corruption and inequities. The goals of housing reform were to solve these problems through urban housing privatisation, commercialisation and socialisation. This study examines China's urban housing reform through a case study of the city of Jinan. It first reviews the history of housing development in Jinan from the 1950s to the 1980s, and then analyses Jinan's reform practices in the 1990s. Its finding is that, after many years' efforts, housing reform in Jinan has made substantial progress, but mostly with respect to privatisation. The problem of housing shortages has been addressed and crowding has lessened considerably. Anecdotal evidence suggests that corruption is less widespread than in the past. The other important housing problem, inequity, still exists and, in some respects, has even worsened. In particular, a new form of horizontal inequity has arisen due to the persistent role of work units in housing provision. This paper suggests that, in the future, the government should take a more positive role rather than leaving the market alone to deal with the problem of housing inequity.",China; Housing policy; Inequity; Reform,equity; housing policy; reform process; urban housing; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141906898,0

Data are analysed from two retrospective life-course surveys conducted in the Netherlands in the 1990s, using multinomial logistic regression models. The paper finds a strong influence of the timing and pathway of leaving on the housing situation immediately after leaving: those nest-leavers who make stronger commitments in their household careers (by cohabiting, or by marrying) are more likely to own a home and less likely to share. Although through the years after leaving home this influence decreases, it remains discernible and significant even eight years after leaving.

This ties in with a general policy to promote an 'urban renaissance', largely because of its claimed advantages for sustainability. However, there has been little testing to date of sustainability impacts in practice. This is particularly true for the social equity aspect of sustainability, despite its acknowledged centrality to the concept. This paper outlines the development of a theory of social equity in relation to urban form and presents empirical research based on this to test the case of the so-called 'compact city', that is, high-density, mixed-use urban form. The research involved a comparative investigation of a range of alleged social equity impacts in 25 medium-sized English cities of differing levels and types of compactness. The findings suggest that, in certain respects and with certain qualifications, the compact city has the potential to promote social equity. Likely benefits include reduced car dependency and lower levels of social segregation, while the main problem is likely to be a lack of affordable, decent-sized homes. Positive effects are emerging in response to re-urbanisation and development on derelict land, and the cities which most support equity appear to be those that have a large proportion of high-density housing and a large quantity of locally provided services and facilities.",Density; Re-urbanisation; Social justice,environmental planning; housing policy; social justice; sustainability; urbanization; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042568925,1

Drawing on data collected in focus groups in three localities, this paper illustrates the everyday nature of environmental concern for disadvantaged groups. While the language of environmentalism was largely absent in the interviews, participants expressed considerable concern about the impact of their surroundings on health and quality of life. Rather than existing as a separate category of concern, however, complaints about environmental quality were bound up with wider assessments of local life, the effectiveness of local agencies and participants' sense of their own influence. The character of participants' local environmental concern is illustrated by focusing on their discussions of health and safety at home and in the streets and public spaces around them, before discussing their experiences of living with pollution.

Discussion draws on household level research conducted in three West Coast US cities (Portland, Seattle and San Francisco) representing a hierarchy of size, status and growth management. Detailed analysis of 60 two-wage household 'biographies' highlights the way decision making (and ultimately compromise) shapes human-environment interaction. Evidence is presented which shows high levels of dissonance between stated preference for compact, mixed-use neighbourhoods and non-localised lived relations between different daily activities and communities.

Poor energy efficiency results in a number of social problems, including fuel poverty and ill health, as well as excess energy consumption which leads to high levels of energy-related environmental emissions; the policy context for these air pollutants is now well established. In light of these policy-drivers, this paper presents a cross-country analysis of housing conditions, energy-efficiency levels, affordability and satisfaction with housing in 14 European countries using longitudinal datasets from the European Community Household Panel for the years 1994-97. Very little empirical analysis of European housing conditions has been undertaken previously. The results indicate the existence of three main typologies in Europe as regards housing conditions, with serious housing deprivation in southern Europe, in terms of poor thermal efficiency, high fuel poverty, burdensome housing costs and low housing-satisfaction rates. In northern Europe, problems of damp and overcrowding are found, especially in the UK, Ireland, France and Belgium.

Some scholars have argued that the social and spatial structure of such cities has been polarised, because of changing demand for labour and land. A number of debates have developed around this hypothesis, challenging the general applicability of these socio-economic trends to all global cities (e.g. Bruegel, 1996; Hamnett, 1996), while the spatial changes in the housing markets of global cities have been shown to be varied (Marcuse & van Kempen, 2000). They are heavily dependent on local context, but always associated with increased segregation of rich and poor, whether through displacement of the poor from the urban core (Smith, 1989) or through their displacement within it (Lyons, 1996). The present paper suggests that much can be learnt about urban change in an era of globalisation, from analysis of the differences between global and other cities. The hypothesis is that spatial restructuring of housing markets in London, a global city, is likely to have important similarities with those of other cities in England, which occupy lower positions in a global urban hierarchy. A comparison of the extent of socio-spatial clustering of home ownership in London, with six English cities at various levels of the urban hierarchy is presented, which partly supports the hypothesis, comparing change over a 20-year period, based on cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of ONS Longitudinal Study data for the years 1971, 1981 and 1991. Findings were that, despite its more socially polarised labour market, London's home ownership market was less spatially segregated than that of other cities in the sample. Implications for global city theory, and for the interpretation of the dynamics of other urban markets, are discussed.",Clustering; Displacement; Gentrification; Global cities; Home ownership; Polarisation; Segregation,homeownership; housing market; social segregation; urban economy; world city; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037492599,1

This paper examines the transience of housebuilders in Ontario from 1978 to 1998. Using a census of builders provided by the Ontario New Home Warranty Program, the industry's firm membership is found to be extremely transient. Most transience comes by way of new firm formation and permanent firm exits from the market, while a small cohort of builders withdraw from and re-enter the market on a regular basis. The business cycle speeds and slows these processes but flux is due primarily to the annual turnover of small builders. To reduce transience, policy makers must decide between slowing entry and perhaps raising industry concentration or allowing continued firm entry and probably transience.",Firms; Housebuilding; Transience,construction industry; firm size; industrial structure; turnover; Canada,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037492581,1

The hypothesis is advanced that Scotland, although a more rural country, has made less use of planning policy to tackle issues relating to the need for rural social housing. In both countries scale of provision has lagged behind perceived need and a major reason for this would appear to be the tensions in planning policy between environmental and social sustainability objectives, with the scales so far weighted towards the environmental rather than the social imperative.",Affordable housing; Planning; Rural housing; Social justice,affordable housing; comparative study; housing policy; planning system; rural area; social justice; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038695002,1

The implications of these processes for housing strategy formation at the regional level are then assessed. The development of regional housing strategies is then considered against three key challenges: The growth of 'network' forms of governance, the applicability of the regional level as a tier for strategy formulation and development, and the different policy responses in other sectors towards housing market change at the sub-national level.

The evaluation framework examines the goals set for social housing organisations, the processes by which they are set, and the ways in which goals are monitored and enforced. The assessment reveals that, whilst it would be a mistake to suggest that housing policies and administrative frameworks have been traditionally monolithic across Britain, there is evidence that they are now diverging further, and that policy priorities for housing associations are coming to reflect local circumstances and locally-determined decisions to a greater extent than hitherto. The utility of the evaluation framework is thus demonstrated.

Using a national survey carried out in 1996 and a technique of multi-level modelling, the empirical study suggests that while private housing is becoming an important option, renters who can access public housing are still more likely to choose public housing because of heavy subsidies. Yet, renters with rural and temporary hukou, and those working in low-ranking work units are at a disadvantage in the housing market. In general they do not qualify for public housing, and private housing is their only option.

The paper argues that targeted housing and regeneration policy has limited effectiveness in dealing with the scale of the problems of low demand in Britain's northern cities and that a more strategic and planned policy agenda is required. The residential structure of cities in the north of England and the Midlands remain, disproportionately a product of the Victorian infrastructure which was built to fulfil the socio-economic circumstances of the time and the monolithic social housing neighbourhoods conceived during the 1940s and the 1950s. Since the mid-1970s housing and urban policy has concentrated on preserving and managing this infrastructure and initiated limited restructuring of small neighbourhoods. The scale of market change now being experienced in some urban areas is rapidly making this public policy framework redundant and as a consequence many existing New Labour regeneration initiatives will be undermined. Using administrative data at sub-regional, local and neighbourhood level (see Appendix), this paper illustrates processes and outcomes affecting housing abandonment in Liverpool. The paper also discusses policy responses within Liverpool and how these relate to the emerging pattern of abandonment and neighbourhood decline. The paper concludes by assessing the limitations of the current approach to regeneration in cities experiencing changing demand for low-income neighbourhoods, assessing the appropriate spatial scale of interventions and discusses the implications for housing strategies and regenerative partnerships.",Changing demand; Housing market restructuring; Low demand,demand analysis; economic regeneration; housing market; housing policy; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037245527,1

This paper seeks to apply the broader framework of residential mobility, using the vacancy chain concept to examine the knock-on implications across the entire housing market. Taking the case study of Stockholm, it is shown that tenure conversions from rental to co-operative ownership are of limited direct significance for gentrification. However, the indirect effects of this process, through the linked chains of household moves initiated, serve to reinforce other gentrification mechanisms operating within the rental sector, such as allocation mechanisms for rental housing. Therefore, the impacts of gentrification can be significantly underestimated if the wider effects on the housing market are ignored.

Most of this literature arose out of quantitative research approaches but writers drew attention to the inability of these approaches to capture the increasing complexity of family life and residential mobility. Drawing on data from the Christchurch, New Zealand, house and home study, this study argues that the qualitative ethnographic method used provides a more holistic approach to, and understanding of, the events and issues which influence household mobility over time. Within this context, the paper presents excerpts from interview data framed as ontological narratives and related stories embedded in social and economic contexts.

It discusses the ways in which tenant participation arrangements, in addition to providing opportunities for tenants to influence organisational decision making, potentially serve as de facto conduits for organisational learning, prompting organisational adaptation and change. The idea of the 'learning organisation, has its roots in organisational theory and practice. It has also been used normatively in management consultancy, and it is a discernible part of the managerial culture associated with the present government's Modernisation programme. The paper has three interrelated aims. First, it looks at the scope of the 'learning organisation' notion. This is broadly concerned with organisational commitment to on-going development, and focuses on responsiveness, flexibility and capacity to adapt internally to external demands and pressures. Second, it considers the role that these 'learning organisation' principles play in the process of organisational change as this is experienced by today's social housing organisations. Third, it applies learning organisation concepts and draws on recent research to examine an aspect of social housing practice which acts as a key interface between social housing organisations and their service users, the management of tenant participation in an operational context, and discusses the extent to which such mechanisms might act as a conduit for the development of organisational learning. The paper concludes by reflecting first, on the potential of such conduits to encourage social housing organisations to become more like 'learning organisations'; and second, on the value of the learning organisation notion as a tool for understanding organisational development and change in social housing.",Organisational development; Organisational learning; Tenant participation,learning; organizational change; social housing; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036881110,0

This study aims to uncover in what way the postponement of marriage and childbirth that took place in the second half of the 20th century in the Netherlands affected the timing of moving into 'long-stay housing' (single-family dwellings and owner occupied dwellings). This is done by analysing time lags between household events and housing events. Survival analysis shows that over cohorts, moving into long-stay housing happens consistently earlier, and increasingly frequently before first childbirth. This finding is most likely attributable to the increased economic prosperity and increased availability of long-stay housing. This allows young people to adjust their housing to the household situation they anticipate, rather than to wait until they actually experience the household event. However, this does not hold for single home leaves: they move into long-stay housing neither earlier, nor much more often over time. It is concluded that the level of commitment in the household situation is the fundamental explanation for housing choice, and that economic prosperity mainly facilitates advancement in the timing of adapting the housing situation to the (anticipated) household situation.",Households; Housing; Survival analysis; Timing,age at marriage; demographic trend; homeownership; young population; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036736342,0

Its ambitions are modest, in part because so little research has been conducted on the sector, as a consequence of the small size of the sector as well as the concentration of socio-political, economic and policy analyses on the other major housing sectors, namely public renting and home ownership. It is argued that a fundamental function of private renting, to provide a functional substitute and counter-balance to distortions in the market for private home ownership, has been systematically undermined in Hong Kong. In spite of its historical importance in meeting Hong Kong people's housing needs, the sector's decline has been steep and it can now be fairly described as a marginalised tenure, despite incomplete structural adjustment post- Asian Financial Crisis. It is suggested that a fundamental reason for the decline of the private rental sector has been the impact of governmental policy, which undermined the private rental sector and thus an important element of the market mechanism in housing provision. The government's ideology of home ownership has also functioned to transfer lower middle-income families into the owner occupied sector.

Owners of single-family dwellings generally enjoy a high degree of control and autonomy. Many home owners, however, are in circumstances which involve greater collective interest, medium and high-rise environments and significant state involvement and regulation. In such situations, tensions and conflicts can arise among residents and others stakeholders in relation to a range of management and maintenance issues and between owners and the wider public interest. This involves constraints on individual freedom and the necessity for co-operation. This paper discusses these and related issues with a particular focus on owners' corporations in Hong Kong. In the Hong Kong context, home owners are most typically in large scale, high rise and often technically complex environments. The particular form of the owner corporation is explored in relation to its history of development, its significance in the home ownership sector and its legal structure. Owner corporations raise a number of issues of participation and democracy. These include the anti-democratic organisational arrangement of owners' corporations which tends to limit rather than enhance participation of ordinary owners, the impact of owners' corporations in reinforcing class and income gaps as well as debates on individualism/collectivism and public/private dimensions. In policy terms there are important questions of regulation and the nature of urban management in high rise and high density environments.",Condominium; Home ownership; Hong Kong,homeownership; multistorey building; property rights; public goods; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036734899,0

In market-dominant models, housing is strongly commodified and geared to those with the ability to pay, while social housing is relegated to a residual role. An examination of the position in Ireland in recent years shows that housing provision has been overwhelmingly via the market, which is underpinned by tenure-biased policies and state subsidies. This is reflected in the erosion of social-housing production to low levels and the failure to provide for the housing needs of a whole range of social groups. This model has generated a number of problems, including an escalation in house prices and rents, and inequalities.

Community self-build is agency-initiated, builders are unskilled and usually working for state benefits and the finished houses belong to a housing association. The paper outlines how housing regulations, state benefits, (which are increasingly restrictive for young people), and training structures hinder community self-build projects. More-over, community self-build schemes are usually set up in areas of social deprivation where the labour market is difficult, housing often residualised and the young people likely to be recruited are already alienated from education and training.

The basic assumption behind that attitude seems to be that large concentrations of (ethnic) immigrants would prevent their full integration and thus participation in society. Such a risk of insufficient integration would particularly be great when the immigrant population occupies the lower positions of the socio-economic ladder. However, two things should be investigated with care. First, what are the actual explanations for the social and spatial divisions that are encountered in cities? What does that imply for the (Spatial) inequality in Dutch cities? Second, what can be said about the effects of recent changes that can be observed with respect to the explanatory dimensions in the Dutch context? How do these compare to the actual size and stability over recent years of the spatial patterns of immigrants? Popular images of the processes of immigration describe the development of 'ethnic ghettos'. These would particularly develop where state intervention in the spheres of housing and in many other spheres is small or, as in the Netherlands, is declining. This paper investigates whether that view does justice to the actual development, applying micro-level data on immigrant settlement patterns in the city of Amsterdam over the period 1994-99. It is argued that ethnic residential concentrations tend not to be stable and are just growing areal units, but many changes can be shown, which may reflect processes of housing careers and of integration in society.",Concentrations; Immigrants; Integration; Segregation,ethnic minority; immigrant population; migrants experience; social segregation; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036265248,1

Both groups first arrived in Toronto in the late 1980s but under different circumstances and with different outcomes in the housing market. The study is situated in a general conceptual framework focusing on factors affecting the housing careers of households. The analysis is based on a questionnaire survey of 60 respondents from each group who arrived in Canada between 1987 and 1994. Information was collected about the search for three residences: the first permanent residence, the one immediately before the current one and the current residence. The analysis considers the individual and household characteristics that differentiate the Polish and Somali respondents, the characteristics of Toronto's rental market that potentially act as barriers in the search for housing, the housing search process and the outcomes of the search. The latter includes the nature of the dwelling and its surroundings as well as satisfaction with the dwelling and neighbourhood. The results confirm that the Poles have been more successful than the Somalis in establishing a progressive housing career. The reasons relate to differences in individual and household characteristics and the nature of the local housing market. Specific variables include socio-economic status, household size, community resources, the housing situation before coming to Canada, Toronto's tight rental market and perceived discriminatory barriers in that market.

The supply of dwellings and their accessibility as well as the households' resources as constraining factors are explicitly recognised. This study reports a strong impact of higher income and increased household size on the households' moves to larger dwellings, and, in some cases, a move from rented into owner-occupied dwellings. This is in accordance with results from earlier residential mobility studies. Therefore, it would be expected that Turks go through more or less the same housing career as indigenous households, in this case as Swedes, but this is not true. The study reports that Turkish immigrant households are less likely to move out of the municipal rented sector and have a higher probability of remaining in certain immigrant-dense areas of the municipality than indigenous Swedish households.",Housing career; Immigrants; Life-course; Residential mobility,housing conditions; housing market; immigrant population; migrants experience; residential mobility; Sweden,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036263533,1

The discussion demonstrates that these housing careers are markedly differentiated by ethnicity, gender, locality and class, which affect peoples' housing decisions and strategies in various ways.

A career approach is necessary to explain these less favourable housing conditions because the present situation cannot be seen separately from decisions taken earlier.

It is also argued that the ethnic cultural approach, which stresses the housing preferences of minority ethnic groups, does not adequately explain the housing conditions and housing careers of the Turks and Moroccans in the Netherlands.",Ethnic minorities; Housing careers; Residential segregation; The Netherlands,ethnic minority; housing conditions; housing market; social segregation; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036259831,0

As part of a trend towards the privatisation and decentralisation of public services, housing associations are becoming more self-reliant. Government financial support is decreasing and parts of the housing market are changing in response to low demand. To ensure that housing associations run an economic, efficient and financially sound business, knowledge of the financial performance of their stock is becoming more important for their investment policy. In the Netherlands, these general changes in housing policy, management and market have been a prominent feature of the last decade, and have resulted in a variety of responses under the general heading of asset and portfolio management. This paper describes methods for valuation, risk analysis and portfolio management for housing associations. The paper sets out the context within which Dutch housing associations operate. Existing methods for valuation and risk analysis are evaluated for their applicability to social landlords. These methods are placed within the business planning process to show how the methods can be used to inform asset management strategy.

Initially, Chile needed World Bank support and finance, but once this had been achieved it followed its own agenda. The Inter-American Development Bank and USAID faired little better. Chile was master in its own house. Was this a victory for national autonomy over the power of international finance? Clearly not, because the new model being applied in Chile was the precursor of much that was implemented from Washington in the days of structural adjustment. Chile 'won' because it accepted the rules of the new game established by institutions far more powerful than the multilateral development banks.

However, the present analysis reveals that, in England, this has been directed to home-centred living and personal privacy more than in Japan, where the main focus continued to be on family-centred living and familial privacy.

The eligibility criteria and allocation procedures pertaining to public housing help channel certain groups of residents into a narrow array of housing types in strictly defined locations. Particular socio-demographic features of lower-income Indians, coupled with their numerical inferiority, leads to a weak position within the housing market.

The paper finds that dispersed residents have job networks containing more diverse information. Second, dispersed residents more often used formal methods to find their most recent job. Third, dispersed residents seek better jobs, net of demographic controls, search method, and search outcome. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for the design of housing mobility and mixed-income housing programmes, the current policy emphasis at the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.",Housing mobility; Job search; Social networks,accessibility; job search; mobility; social housing; womens status; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036142370,0

The best available evidence suggests that families in public housing who receive rental subsidies to move from high- to lower-poverty areas may experience reductions in welfare receipt and improvements in health status. Such moves may also improve schooling outcomes for children and reduce their problem behaviours. The benefits to society from these changes are substantial when measured in dollar terms.

These residential property companies have a reduced tax liability compared with normal property companies. However, no housing investment trusts have so far been established and none seem likely to be set up. This paper reports on qualitative interviews with financial institutions to examine why housing investment trusts have proved to be a policy failure.

Many issues of importance to housing specialists received little or no attention, most notably that of low demand. Some policy variations within the UK were evident, for example in attitudes towards greenfield development, home ownership and stock transfer.

In conventional thinking the enabling strategy focuses on the ability of the private sector, specifically the 'markets', to deliver housing. Enabling has been promoted as consisting of, primarily, decentralisation, privatisation, deregulation and demand-driven development. The focus of the policy prescriptions is to reduce the 'damaging' involvement of the state. This paper presents evidence from slum redevelopment programmes in Mumbai, India, to demonstrate that enabling is likely to be much more complicated. Paradoxically, enabling housing provision through market mechanisms may require four levels of seeming policy contradictions-both decentralisation and centralisation; both privatisation and public investment; both deregulation and new regulations, and both demand-driven and supply-driven development. In other words, enabling is likely to require a different type of state involvement, not necessarily less state involvement. A complex and more sophisticated role of the state is necessary to provide the institutional support for well functioning property markets, as well as to capture the opportunities high value property markets provide.",Bombay; Decentralisation; Housing; Upgrading,decentralization; housing project; housing provision; property market; state role; India,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035200607,0

One scheme is managed by a local authority housing department, the other two by different housing associations. Analysis reveals that sheltered housing has significant social consequences in respect of tenants' experiences of this setting as a communal, age-segregated environment. In particular, exploration of the subject of self-esteem in respect to these aspects of the environment highlights both positive and negative features of social life in sheltered housing. Conclusions are reached that in evaluating this form of housing, and any such provision set up exclusively for older people, researchers and providers must pay greater attention to the subject of social interaction, and its benefits and challenges to older people.",Age-segregation; Older people; Self-esteem; Sheltered housing,elderly population; housing association; housing provision; social housing; social segregation; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035196517,0

Whilst improved housing amenity and image of the areas are crucial components of estate regeneration, it is argued that these aspects will not automatically benefit existing socio-economically disadvantaged residents. In the current political context, three key questions are raised: (1) In whose images the estates are being recreated, housing authorities, private property developers or residents?; (2) Whether the physical images are being imposed or democratised and used for the purposes of community development?; and (3) What the overall consequences and housing policy implications are likely to be? It is argued that the entry of market capital and the buying and selling of place through physical image reconstruction, to attract more affluent residents to the estates, is likely to add to rather than ameliorate the inequality of current public housing residents.",Public housing; Social housing; Social justice; Urban regeneration,economic regeneration; housing conditions; housing policy; social justice; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035192663,0

Lacking data on ethnic status, the birthplace and language data are used to explore Sydney's residential geography at two spatial scales, and to identify the degree of residential segregation of each birthplace and language group. Regression analysis, used to assess the relevance of human capital to observed levels of segregation, suggests that Boal's assimilation scenario accounts for most of the observed geographies, with some additional pluralism but little evidence of polarisation.

Structural changes in the industry have presented mortgage lenders with strategic choices, rather than dictated a single viable course. Structural change necessitated demutualisation only in the limited cases where a larger plc took over a small mutual. Case studies of each of the building societies that have converted indicated four other principal reasons for demutualisation: (1) an attempt to maintain full organisational independence; (2) an attempt to maintain operational independence; (3) a growth by acquisition strategy; and (4) a members' revolt.

This paper evaluates whether home owners in Hong Kong have a higher sense of social belonging than renters and finds that tenure status is a spurious independent variable in assessing respondents' sense of belonging to Hong Kong. Logistic regression analysis suggests that the significance of tenure is greatly reduced when other variables, namely age, identity, income and foreign abode right are controlled. The analysis also shows that those possessing a comparatively high sense of social belonging tend to bear the identification of Hong Kong Chinese, be older, have high incomes, and hold no foreign right of abode. Of the control variables, the factor of 'identity' appears most influential. Hong Kong's relationship with China, the uncertain nature of a Hong Kong identity and the territory's economic trajectory as a higher order services economy has meant that housing policy, specifically the promotion of home ownership, is perceived by the government as influencing values and behaviour very narrowly defined as promoting social belonging primarily in a territorial of geographical sense, with wider implications of neighbourhood stability unconsidered.",Home ownership; Hong Kong; Social belonging; Social capital,homeownership; human capital; identity construction; national identity; sense of place; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034993575,1

It has been argued that the process of globalisation results in increased social polarisation and subsequently sharper spatial segregation. Indeed, many politicians express a fear of rising segregation, envisioning the emergence of 'ghettos' or as it is called in the Netherlands 'income neighbourhoods'. In order to prevent concentrations of poverty from forming, a new area-based policy was formulated which aimed to restructure the urban housing market at the neighbourhood level and mix low-quality with high-quality houses. Such a concern with social mix has become common in a number of developed countries. In this regard the analysis has a wide relevance. This paper explores these ideas both by discussing the theoretical framework underpinning the policy, and by examining empirical support for it. Since the policy of housing-quality mixing is still in the first phase of implementation, relevant longitudinal data is not yet available. As a consequence our evaluation addresses present poverty concentrations and housing stock (mix) characteristics in the city of Amsterdam. By comparing neighbourhoods that already have a 'mixed' housing stock to homogeneous neighbourhoods, it has been possible to see whether mixing really does correspond to significantly lower poverty rates. It turns out that the empirical facts are quite different from the expected results: mixing does not in fact reduced poverty. It is concluded that the policy lacks an empirical basis. Housing-mix policy requires substantial budgets, while the goal of reducing poverty cannot be reached. As an alternative, we suggest that poverty is a personal characteristic and that it is therefore preferable to approach poverty directly instead of hoping for the results of a dubious 'neighbourhood effect'.",Housing market; neighbourhood effect; Neighbourhood mix; Polarisation; Policy; Poverty; Segregation; The Netherlands,housing policy; poverty; social policy; social segregation; urban society; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034989017,1

In explaining these differences, consideration should be given to each elderly immigrant group's own value system, norms and preferences. It is argued that one necessary task in this endeavour is to gain knowledge about different elderly immigrant groups' understandings of what a home symbolises-what home means to them in the context of their particular ways of thinking and culture. From this point of view, the paper concludes that, when investigating the meaning of 'home' among elderly immigrants, an integrative theoretical approach based on an experiential perspective and a phenomenological and developmental perspective are deemed appropriate to be adopted.",Elderly immigrants; Experiental perspective; Meaning of 'home'; Phenomenological and developmental perspective,academic research; elderly population; immigrant population; knowledge; perception; theoretical study,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034988301,0

This area of public policy has been seemingly been little researched being passed over for more high profile urban policy initiatives such as Enterprise Zones and Urban Development Corporations. Such studies largely demonstrate a translation of broad New Right principles into practice. Recently, however, attention has begun to turn to less obvious approaches and a more sensitive and contradictory image has developed. Far from consistency and coherence, evidence of actual impact upon the ground is beginning to point to a more eclectic situation. While there may have been broad principles that could be identified with the Thatcher and Major Governments throughout the 1980s and 1990s, such abstract tenets allowed significant room for evolution and pragmatism, which may, in part, help explain the varied impact of many initiatives. Examination of neighbourhood regeneration policies throughout this period demonstrates an evolution of initiatives and ideas that were influenced by a number of factors. Two stand out in particular. First, a temporal dimension: policy and thinking evolved due to external influences (such as opposition from local authorities and tenants) and the impact of policy itself. Second, a spatial dimension: policy outcome varied in different places. The implications of this are that a more open and less reductionist perspective on the New Right needs to be taken and that studies of the period should highlight a more diverse and contextualised understanding.",Major government; Neighbourhood regeneration; Tatcher government; The new right,historical perspective; neighborhood; planning history; urban planning; urban renewal; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034984337,0

Although the sector remains a net exporter of households, it was found that only part of the reverse flow back into private renting could be accurately described as a process of 'falling out' of the two main tenures.

This paper focuses on 'in-place' adjustments and suggests its further recognition relative to mobility in both theoretical and empirical terms. By reviewing the main housing choice debates, the paper endeavours to show how the mobility-centred approach is insufficient to capture and explain those housing choice situations where non-market options of housing provision are significant. This is important for an understanding of housing choice not only in societies in transition, but also as far as non-market (public and self-help) provision of housing is recognised. The paper explores two specific types of 'in-place' housing adjustments: change in the housing status and major physical alteration of the residence of non-movers. For this purpose, Slovenian social survey data were used. Focusing on the present housing episode, its median duration was found to be very long and a surprisingly high incidence of such 'in-place dynamism' was found.

At the start of this period there was considerable conformity in price levels among the eight centres, but by the mid-1990s wide disparity in the price structure had emerged, with Vancouver and Toronto (and their satellites) having broken away from the rest as a result of rapid price inflation after 1985. At the same time, the cities showing the most marked gains also suffered the heaviest losses during economic downturns. The geography and timing of rapid- price inflation coincided with the onset of heavy and concentrated immigration in Toronto and Vancouver after 1985, and the remainder of the paper considers the relations in these cities between price change and globalisation in general, immigration in particular. In both cities, and especially Vancouver, aside from growth in the provincial GDP, conventional regional and national factors seem to have declining significance in accounting for price movements, while indicators of globalisation, including immigration, exert stronger effects.

It suggests that, generally, lenders do not perceive 'flexible mortgages' as a solution to the problem, and in many cases do not even recognise that there is a problem. The flexible mortgage is rather seen as a marketing tool for lenders, or a financial service for the financially secure and astute borrower.

This seems to confirm Harloe's assertion that social housing in Europe is only a transitional tenure. Even in the Netherlands-champion of social rented housing within the European Union-the owner occupied sector would seem destined to marginalise the social rented sector in the long run. This paper argues that the housing corporations, being private, independent social entrepreneurs, will be only partially inclined to take the political message of the Housing Memorandum to heart. It is expected that the Dutch social rented sector will remain a differentiated sector and continue to blossom alongside home ownership.

The paper focuses primarily on those borrowers most likely to experience the risks associated with home ownership and least financially able to respond to them. For these low-income borrowers, access to, and the effectiveness of, social protection is critical. The data presented are drawn from two surveys of mortgagors, one of private insurance claimants and the other of those claiming on the state safety-net. The discussion indicates that the nature of the 'new' safety-net provision in Britain is problematic. Low-income borrowers are currently least likely to take or have access to MPPI. Where they do have MPPI, they are relatively less successful than better off borrowers in sustaining a claim. For those without MPPI, the deferral period before receiving state assistance (ISMI), and the restrictions to the assistance when it is paid, result in a large minority developing mortgage arrears.

Housing policy development is increasingly taking the more comprehensive approach. The first phases of international housing policy, 1972-83, represented in sites and services (and related in situ slum upgrading) projects, could never become completely effective. These approaches had only fragmentary relationships to general land policies, to the development of housing finance systems, and to the broader economic, social and institutional conditions for enhancing the qualities and supplies of housing. In due time the theoretical and practical limitations became apparent and various international aid agencies, including the World Bank, adopted broader, more sophisticated thinking in housing, leading to a quest for whole sector housing development. But in the late 1990s, within managerial reforms in the World Bank, the specialist housing section was disbanded and the staff dispersed to other sections. This paper provides an historical explanation for the change, along with critical commentaries on the potential dilemmas with the modern, more comprehensive approaches. It is argued that policy and research agendas should be more evidently based upon understanding of the developmental dialectic between the economic, the social and the political. The development welfare of such a dialectic has authority and legitimacy from several Nobel prize winners in the 1990s.

A new public management (NPM) analytical framework is adopted which provides seven dimensions, disaggregation, competition, private sector management, economy, hands-on top management, standards of performance and measurement of outputs. Overlying these dimensions it is argued that there are two NPM meta-themes-externalisation (which relates to the first two characteristics) and managerialisation (the latter five). Hypotheses are developed to explain the differential impact of NPM reforms on the municipal housing and housing association sectors. These suggest that housing associations are externalised and highly managerialised organisations whereas local authorities display lower levels of externalisation and limited managerialisation. Analysis of the transfer process indicates that externalisation is driven by political and ideological approaches to public housing in addition to NPM dimensions, but that as local authorities transfer their stock into the housing association sector they are also likely to develop into similarly managerialised organisations. In conclusion the NPM framework is demonstrated to need further development whilst systematic research is required on management reform in social housing provision. The lesson to emerge on how to abolish public housing suggests the following policy formula: starve it of resources, create a hostile environment and wait, in the goodness of time it will abolish itself!",Housing associations; Management reform; Municipal housing; New public management,housing association; housing policy; policy development; social housing; England; United Kingdom; Wales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034774210,0

Previous research has shown that it is possible to decipher a statistical relationship between the onset of mortgage indebtedness and health. This paper extends this work by examining how this statistical patterning is generated at the level of the 'lived experiences' of families experiencing the loss of their mortgaged home. The narratives of 44 adults and 10 children from a sample of 30 households who have experienced mortgage possession are analysed. The results of this qualitative analysis are related to current debates in both the sociology of health inequalities and the sociology of the emotions concerned with the specification of what Elstad has called 'the psychological stress, relative deprivation and psycho-social injuries of inequality structures'.",,debt; housing; investment; medical geography; stress; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034117085,1

A problem for urban studies, however, is that the supposed causal relationships underlying this correlation are ill-understood and only weakly established. Hence the expectation that housing improvement will lead to a corresponding change in the health of the community (and therefore of individuals) has little causal support and remains an assumption. Studies of renewal schemes have rarely operated at the micro process level which would allow this assumption to be tested. Moreover, significant changes in health are likely to occur only over a relatively long period; hence measurement is difficult and ascribing causation problematic. One way of approaching this research problem is to examine what impact the uninvited, and frequently dramatic, renewal process itself has on the health of the individual. In this research an interpretive biographical interview method was used to elicit tenants' understanding of their situation, of the experience of housing renewal and how it impacted upon their health and well-being. In some cases the process itself was indeed stressful and damaging while in others enjoyable and rewarding. This pointed to a complex web of factors but predominant and influential was that of personal control, its degree of importance to the individual and, crucially, its negotiability. This paper looks at the connections between control and health and re-introduces into the housing policy arena the importance of the individual whose interests are currently submerged in the 'imperatives' of community involvement and consultation. The research contributes to a housing-health linkages model (Easterlow et al., 2000) by introducing, as an important factor affecting health and well-being, the nature of the tenant/landlord relationship itself in the social rented sector and examining the potential for a new partnership at this 'micro' level.",,health impact; housing conditions; medical geography; renewal policy; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034116383,0

This paper draws on the National Child Development Study to examine the impact upon health of poor housing through the life course. The analysis takes the novel approach of constructing a composite severity of ill health measure to act as the dependent variable. Poor housing is operationalised through a housing deprivation index calculated for each sweep of the NCDS. The index of multiple housing deprivation goes beyond traditional concerns with the quality and amenity of a dwelling to incorporate key subjective factors such as satisfaction with dwelling or residential area: these subjective factors play a particularly important role in the index. The key result is that, even when other relevant factors are allowed for, the NCDS data suggest that experience of both current and past poor housing is significantly associated with greater likelihood of ill health. Moreover, for those who are living in non-deprived housing conditions in adulthood, ill health is more likely among those who experienced housing deprivation in earlier life than among those who did not. Thus, history matters. The analysis also highlights the increasing inadequacy of conventional measures of housing deprivation.",,health impact; housing conditions; medical geography; poverty; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034116382,1

Capital gains and net benefits are measured using unit record data from valuation records of the 1980s and a survey carried out by the Australian Institute of Family Studies in 1991 of over 2500 families in Sydney and Melbourne. Higher socio-economic groups generally had significantly larger dollar gains than groups below them and, by this measure, homeownership adds to inequalities generated through the labour market. However, because they had commenced purchase with smaller deposits, the low socio-economic groups did as well or better than other groups when capital gains are expressed as a percentage return on deposits. Capital gains are one of the variables included in a measure of net housing benefits; an attempt to quantify all the major benefits and costs involved in purchase rather than renting. The net housing benefits accruing to different socio-economic groups since deregulation of finance markets are compared using survey data relating to the 1980s property boom, and estimates using the much lower rates of interest and capital gains in housing markets of the 1990s. Again, there is a strong association found between dollar benefits and socio-economic status. The paper concludes that, measured in dollar terms, the distribution of net housing benefits in Sydney and Melbourne has had a substantial class bias since deregulation, tending to create a more unequal society.",,capital market; homeownership; income distribution; poverty; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034100025,1

A critique of the way that the history of housing has been written shows that it has generally been taken for granted that the perceived failings of the model dwellings companies and trusts in the 19th century led inevitably to the emergence of municipal housing. Evidence is presented to show that in fact the voluntary providers continued to be active, and that the dominance of council housing was not resolved until after 1918. This suggests that there is a strong case for more detailed research on the growth and development of modern housing associations.

Such grants have been the major mechanism for delivering state support to home-owners with repairs and improvements and at times have formed a major component of public spending. Grant aid, usually covering 50 per cent of approved costs, was initially intended as an incentive to owners (mainly landlords) to install amenities and facilities which had not been provided when properties were constructed in the 19th century. With the growth of low-income home ownership, grants were extended to provide assistance with repairs and to cover a greater proportion of the costs of work. In some cases, 100 per cent grants under which the organisation of work was taken out of the owner's hands completely were provided in order to secure better works quality. Unfortunately these approaches coincided with financial retrenchment. From 1990, the government reaffirmed that repairs and improvements were primarily the responsibility of home-owners and grant aid was residualised, that is focused on the poorest households in the worst condition properties, leading to a dramatic reduction in the number of home-owners receiving state assistance. Subsequently other objectives such as community care, public health, energy efficiency and environmental concerns have further eroded the resources available for housing stock renovation. Despite the mismatch between the grant policy mechanism and available resources, there has been little progress in the development of a new philosophy defining the interest of the state in the condition of private sector housing and the respective responsibilities of the state and private owners and the introduction of alternative ways of helping low-income owners with repair and improvement.",,financial provision; homeownership; housing policy; policy strategy; England; United Kingdom; Wales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034095451,0

A postal survey measuring these psycho-social benefits was distributed to a random sample of adults in eight local authority districts in West Central Scotland. From the responses to the survey, three factors were constructed relating to the home as a haven, as a locus of autonomy and as a source of status for the occupants. Multivariate analysis showed that housing tenure is less important as an influence upon the attainment of psycho-social benefits from the home than the neighbourhood context and the incidence of problems with the home. Further, those factors negatively associated with psycho-social benefits appear to be more important than those factors positively associated with such benefits. This suggests that future research should focus on the fact that what detracts from psycho-social benefits may be more important than what contributes to them. A further important finding is that, after controlling for other influences, people living alone derive more benefits from the home as a haven and as a locus of autonomy than people in multi-person households.",,health impact; housing conditions; medical geography; mental health; multivariate analysis; Scotland; United Kingdom,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034076856,1

However, at the same time, the getihu or petty traders, who rank low in terms of occupational status, are also likely to be occupants of open market housing. Household characteristics also show systematic variations between occupants of different types of subsidised housing.

In the study, however, the adverse effects on physical and mental health of unsuitable housing emerged, quite unprompted, as a central theme. The study's findings can be generalised and go beyond the prevailing account of housing and disability in a number of ways. A new way of thinking about domestic environments and disability may mean that the definition of housing need goes beyond stair lifts and ramps to issues of poverty and health, conflict between families, neighbourhoods, and, most centrally of all, the constraints of physical and social space.

To feed into this debate, this paper begins by reviewing the state of the art of research on housing and health. It shows that the majority of work continues to focus on how housing affects health, while the limited attention to how health status affects housing outcomes has concentrated on medical priority for rehousing in the public sector.

Historical tensions concerning the nature and scope of housing management, and its recent establishment as a public sector profession, have been exacerbated by NPM. In particular, the two central NPM processes of externalisation and managerialisation have led to the provision of new social housing by housing associations and the development of rationalistic management. By exploring the changing nature of housing management in externalised housing associations, the paper illustrates the complex ways in which property and welfare-based approaches to housing management are being played out. It is argued that managerialism has worked to define core business and a property-based approach at the expense of aspects of personal and welfare-based services. This process is being intensified by new technologies as seen through the development of call centres. Housing associations and the regulator have sought to recapture some aspects of the welfare approach to housing management to provide services to increasingly welfare-dependent tenants. However, the paper concludes that the tensions between the property and welfare approaches are likely to lead to the domination of a property-based approach because of the ongoing managerial and external pressures on housing associations.",,housing management; housing policy; social housing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034020341,0

The informants were selected from three different welfare sectors-the state, the market, and the family-in order to make a clear distinction among people in terms of their socio-economic status, housing and living arrangements, and degree of family relations. The results of the analysis highlight older people's preference for more independent living with changing family patterns and ideology.

With the liberalisation of the Thai economy and its integration into the world economy during the 1980s and the early 1990s, real estate companies gained access to US$-nominated off-shore loans at low interest rates. Because of the availability of cheap loans and the speculative demand for housing, financial institutions and real estate developers did not conduct market research and invested in doubtful projects, resulting in an enormous oversupply of housing. The close relationship between bankers, developers and politicians ensured that the government would bail out insolvent real estate companies and financial institutions. In 1996, exports fell and the economy stopped growing due to increased international competition. Unhedged foreign debts reached dangerous levels and speculative attacks forced the government to devalue the currency. Real estate companies and financial institutions would have collapsed without continued bail-outs by the government. However, the government's non-transparent policies eroded the confidence of the general public and international investors, resulting in capital flight and a serious financial and economic crisis.",,economic impact; financial crisis; housing market; national economy; Thailand,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033983113,0

However, citizens' dependency on state provision renders them clients of the state, reducing their political power at the ballot box. This emasculating tendency reaches its logical conclusion when the state monopolises the provision of particular goods or services, it is then able to threaten to withhold provision, thus threatening the material life of particular societal segments, if electoral support were not forthcoming from the latter.

The earthquake caused especially heavy damage on the inner-city housing of low-income people and the elderly. Housing recovery progress in the post-disaster period has also been unequal. This paper shows the growing socio-economic and spatial polarisation. The framework of Japan's housing policy is a two-tiered system. On the one hand, most people are encouraged to obtain their own houses by their own efforts on the market, whereas on the other, public housing as residual welfare housing is directly provided for those who are marginal to the market.

The dominant paradigm suggests that people sleeping rough are often individuals who are predisposed to becoming homeless because their individual characteristics make them especially vulnerable to changes in housing supply, labour markets and other structural factors that precipitate homelessness. Policy responses, such as the Rough Sleepers Initiative, have been increasingly characterised by their emphasis on reintegrating people sleeping rough into society on the basis that many in this group are vulnerable people who have become homeless essentially because they need assistance and care. However, there is a marked contrast between this broad consensus and popular views of the causes of rough sleeping. In the popular imagination, rough sleeping is caused by fecklessness, moral weakness and an active choice to sleep on the streets. This view has its origins in pre-20th century views of poverty and exclusion but has recently been reinforced by the ideology of a succession of Neo-Liberal governments in the UK.

A particular focus is placed on the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has emphasised the desirability of 'downwards' accountability to communities while at the same time limiting the central controls of autonomous local bodies. The Committee on Standards in Public Life was established in 1994 by the former Prime Minister, John Major. It was a response to concern about standards of conduct among public office holders, including Members of Parliament, but also all other office holders in central and local government, and in other bodies discharging public functions. Its remit is to investigate current arrangements and make recommendations about changes required to ensure 'the highest standards of propriety in public life'. The paper reports on the governance of community-based housing organisations (CBHOs) in Glasgow, which was investigated by means of housing surveys and interviews with key actors. It finds that in many respects the criticisms of extra-governmental housing organisations do not apply: they are regarded as legitimate and trustworthy by local people to a much greater extent than the local authority and other institutions. They attract active local participation and there are effective mechanisms to ensure that their 'governors' are accountable. What is more, they have maintained their position over a period of more than 10 years. However, the CBHOs have been much less successful in shaping their own destinies, in contrast to extra-governmental housing organisations in England. They are, in reality, dependent rather than autonomous and their power is very limited in comparison to the government agency and local authority with whom they interact. The paper concludes that the CBHOs have been a successful policy innovation which offers real gains for communities and also allows local authorities and central government agencies to pursue their objectives. However, their small scale, which is important in their success as locally-accountable bodies, in turn makes them vulnerable to centralised control.",,community organization; housing association; local government; rental sector; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033892884,0

The paper highlights the confusion surrounding the status of leaseholders as tenants and owners and assesses current proposals for further reform. The analysis is situated in debates about the complexity of 'tenure' as a category, and reveals the extent to which the concept embraces multiple meanings rooted in both legalistic discourse and popular assumption. The paper reflects on the methodological potential of approaching tenure as a construct in order to understand why the leasehold sector in England and Wales has endured and has so far proved relatively immune to attempted legal transformations of its character and function.",,housing market; property market; tenure system; England; United Kingdom; Wales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033888046,0

This is because studies of homelessness have seldom incorporated a longitudinal dimension or have worked with only a simplistic and incomplete picture of homeless people's housing histories. The paper argues for the adoption of a biographical approach in studies of homelessness and reports on the first complete set of accommodation biographies constructed with single homeless hostel users. It is shown that, rather than fitting a description of either the long-term or more recently homeless or following a progressive 'drift' into homelessness, the majority of men interviewed had in fact experienced numerous homeless episodes in the past but with each of these episodes being of relatively limited duration and separated by much longer periods in (their own) accommodation. Examining the nature of that accommodation, it is shown that the housing careers of these men had been almost entirely dominated by the use of poor quality and often insecure private rented bedsits and flats whilst almost all had simultaneously been either long-term or permanently unemployed. With few additional 'vulnerabilities' to help account for their frequent returns to homelessness the paper challenges a conventional 'political model' of single homelessness to explain these men's homeless careers in relation to their position of multiple structural disadvantage. The paper contrasts these biographies with the biographies of those who were either visibly homeless for the first time or who better fitted a description of the truly long-term homeless and concludes by outlining the ways in which a biographical approach might further our understanding of single homelessness more broadly and enable the formulation of more appropriate responses to the problems of homelessness.",,homelessness; housing conditions; housing provision; unemployment,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033872087,1

This provides a firmer basis for investigating the joint distribution of housing wealth, income and other personal characteristics than has hitherto existed. However, a number of difficulties arise which are discussed in this paper. A method is presented and validated, developed in the course of assessing the housing wealth of older home owners, for dealing with the specific problems associated with those who purchased their properties at discounted prices, whether through the Right to Buy or other routes. The method is based on data from the British Household Panel Survey, and subsequently applied to the UK Family Expenditure Survey to explore the housing wealth of older people. It also yields estimates of housing equity for younger people and can be implemented with other similar surveys.",,elderly population; homeownership; household survey; housing market; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033869991,1

Only in Great Britain has this aspect attained prominence on the research agenda. Investigations there have shown that the mode of housing provision mitigates the effects of social fragmentation. Research elsewhere might help to clarify how and why the housing market amplifies or diminishes these effects. The case of the Netherlands is particularly illuminating because of the drastic housing policy reforms made there in recent years, allowing for a before-and-after assessment. This paper traces the effects of policy-and its reforms-on the range of housing conditions. In addition to dealing with the country as a whole, it investigates the changes in cities because of the specific nature of the urban housing stock. The analysis of how the housing conditions of various population categories changed during the period leading up to and following the announcement of the housing reforms of 1989 constitutes the core of the paper. The results show that housing conditions were already changing in the direction of the new policy aims during the 1980s. This casts doubt on the autonomous contribution of housing policy to changing housing conditions. The paper ends with a discussion of the implications of these results.",,housing conditions; housing policy; housing reform; social segregation; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033869942,1

Although declining in relation to home ownership in the two decades after the Second World War, private renting has never fallen below 20 per cent of the total housing stock, a share that it has maintained over the past 40 years. Small, scale petty landlordism has characterised this market sector, with a majority of rental stock owned by individuals. This paper summaries the specific characteristics of rental ownership in Australia, drawing on a recent national survey of landlords carried out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and identifies the key factors responsible for the persistence of this pattern of ownership. The reasons for the absence of institutional investors from this sector are then discussed, based on selective interviews with key players in the banking, insurance and superannuation industries. Current changes in market and policy environments are identified which may, however, increase the likelihood of institutional involvement in the provision of rental housing, in general, and social housing, in particular. The analysis is informed by the results of financial modelling carried out at the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute.",,housing market; investment; rental sector; Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033806071,1

We do not know whether domestic property goes disproportionately to the next generations(s) of men, or to women, or equally to men and women as the Western cognatic system of descent would dictate. This paper explores the line of descent through an argument proffered by two European sociologists, Delphy and Leonard. They maintain that domestic property goes disproportionately to the next generation(s) of men because of the power of patriarchy. However, neither available information, nor data from an Australian case study, confirms this claim. Indeed, there is a suggestion that domestic property goes roughly equally to the next generations of men and women.

The evidence is from 45 single homeless people (among 313 in a succession of ethnographic studies) who reported that eviction made a contribution to their homelessness. Using preceding states and events as criteria, a taxonomy of these once-evicted older homeless people is proposed. For the majority, eviction followed a protracted failure to meet their financial obligations or to keep their property in good condition, and for many, mental health problems or exceptionally low competence in basic domestic skills were contributory factors. The experiences of the group strongly suggest that homelessness can be prevented if support is provided to vulnerable people as difficulties mount. Six risk factors for eviction and subsequent homelessness are identified, and the paper concludes that these markers could be used in experiments to recognise marginally housed people and as a primary prevention measure for homelessness.",,elderly population; homelessness; housing provision; mental health; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033801435,0

This paper focuses upon factors affecting the price structure of residential property in the Belfast Urban Area, examining the relative influence of property characteristics, socio-economic factors and the impact of accessibility. The model employs an accessibility index computed for each of 182 traffic zones and uses transaction data for a sample of 2648 residential properties sold during 1996. Results indicate that accessibility is of little significance in explaining variation in house prices at a city-wide scale but at a sub-market level, particularly in lower-income areas, accessibility can be an important influence. The analysis highlights the importance of investigation at a sub-market level and draws conclusions regarding the complexity of relationships within an urban area.",,accessibility; hedonic analysis; housing market; price determination; urban housing; Belfast; Northern Ireland; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033801226,1

During the late 1980s and the 1990s many publicly owned houses were sold to their existing tenants or other public sector employees. Large numbers of new houses were built by commercial property developers for the emerging urban housing market. As a result, new patterns of residents have emerged. Housing areas of different standards for different social groups became a dominant feature of large Chinese cities at the end of the 1990s. Will the urban poor benefit from these changes and what is their housing situation like under the reformed system? This paper addresses these questions by examining the nature of the emerging urban poor and their accessibility to housing. It involves an assessment of the implications of recent housing reform policies for the disadvantaged groups. The paper identifies two major groups of urban poor in Chinese cities: The poor among the official urban residents and the poor rural to urban migrants.

The overemphasis on versions of social dependence as the problem has encouraged the use of shelters and social programmes to change individual households rather than improvement of kind and amounts of low-rent housing in mixed residential communities. Providing supportive housing to remedy the privations of the poor does make good sense, but mainly if organised to strengthen social reciprocity among households in affordable and relatively diverse residential communities.
